Existing projects written against v1.10.0 should run against v1.11.0 with few if any changes.  If you *do* encounter

== Swagger UI

The new xref:guides/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_SwaggerService[`SwaggerService`] allows link:http://swagger.io[Swagger] spec files
to be generated from the Apache Isis metamodel.  These can be downloaded directly through the `SwaggerResource`
(mapped to `/restful/swagger/public` and `/restful/swagger/private`) as well as from the Wicket UI through the
`SwaggerServiceMenu`.

In addition, the xref:guides/ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_getting-started_simpleapp-archetype[SimpleApp archetype] now bundles
 link:https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui[Swagger UI], which documents the main features of the REST API and
 allows it to be explored.

To enable this in your application, first update the `web.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<servlet>
    <servlet-name>WebjarsServlet</servlet-name>                         <!--1-->
    <servlet-class>org.webjars.servlet.WebjarsServlet</servlet-class>
    <init-param>
        <param-name>disableCache</param-name>
        <param-value>false</param-value>
    </init-param>
    <load-on-startup>2</load-on-startup>
</servlet>
<servlet-mapping>
    <servlet-name>WebjarsServlet</servlet-name>
    <url-pattern>/webjars/*</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
...
<filter>
    <filter-name>IsisSessionFilterForRestfulObjects</filter-name>
    ...
    <init-param>
        <param-name>whenNoSession</param-name>
        <param-value>auto</param-value>                                 <!--2-->
    </init-param>
    <init-param>
        <param-name>passThru</param-name>                               <!--3-->
        <param-value>/restful/swagger</param-value>
    </init-param>
</filter>
----
<1> provides access to the Swagger UI (packaged as a webjar)
<2> issues a 401 status, but with the `WWW-Authenticate` challenge suppressed if requested from the Swagger UI
<3> provides access to the RESTful resource that generates the Swagger spec.

There is also an HTML page to load the Swagger UI itself; this resides in `src/main/webapp/swagger-ui/index.html`.  Copy the link:https://github.com/apache/isis/blob/master/example/application/simpleapp/webapp/src/main/webapp/swagger-ui/index.html[file from Apache Isis' repo], or from the app generated by the xref:guides/ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_getting-started_simpleapp-archetype[SimpleApp archetype].

The text of the simple app's `about/index.html` has also changed (the `<li`> for the `/restful` URL has been replaced with a `/swagger-ui` URL).  If you use link:https://github.com/apache/isis/blob/master/example/application/simpleapp/webapp/src/main/webapp/about/index.html[this file], then update it.

If your application is bootstrapped using an `AppManifest` (recommended;
xref:guides/rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_AppManifest-bootstrapping[here]) then the default implementation of the
`SwaggerService` will automatically be discovered and registered.  However, if you are still using the older
`isis.properties` configuration file to explicitly register services then you will need to add in this service.



== `RoutingService`

The new xref:guides/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_RoutingService[`RoutingService`] SPI service provides a plugin point to the
xref:guides/ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] so that a different object than that returned from an action invocation can be
rendered.

The framework provides a default implementation of this service that will - instead of a void or a `null` result -
render the home page (as per the xref:guides/rgant.adoc#_rgant_HomePage[`@HomePage`] annotation) if there is one.  This
is therefore a subtle change in the UI.  If you wish to retain the original behaviour (to return the "no results" page
instead), then you should implement your own no-op implementation of this service:

[source,java]
----
@DomainService
@DomainServiceLayout(menuOrder="1")
public class IdentityRoutingService implements RoutingService {
    public boolean canRoute(Object original) { return true; }
    public Object route(Object original) { return original; }
}
----


== Wicket Viewer i18n

The xref:guides/ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] (its labels, buttons, messages etc) can now be internationalized using the
xref:guides/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_TranslationService[`TranslationService`].

To enable this, new ``msgId``s and corresponding translations must be added to the `translations.po` file.  Full
details of these ``msgId``s can be found in xref:guides/ugbtb.adoc#_ugbtb_i18n_wicket-viewer[i18n] section of the "beyond the basics" guide.

If no translations are available, then the fallback is to use the previous mechanism, ie Wicket's original resource bundles.
This feature can therefore be considered as optional.
