Most applications written against v1.12.x should run against v1.13.0 with few if any changes.  That said, this release
has removed a small number of features that were dependent on internal APIs, and some configuration properties are
now removed/unsupported.  We therefore do recommend that you read and keep in mind these notes when you upgrade your app.

If you *do* encounter any difficulties then let us know via the link:support.html[users mailing list], so we can
support you and document issues here.


== Command changes

The main feature in `1.13.0` is the xref:guides/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_InteractionContext[`InteractionContext`] domain service
to represent an action invocation/property edit, with the re-positioning of
xref:guides/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_CommandContext[`CommandContext`] to represent the _intention_ to invoke an action/edit a
property.  You can read more about this design in the reference guide on domain services, in the
xref:guides/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_intro_commands-and-events[commands and events] section.

This refactoring completely overhauls the structure of the XML mementos passed to
xref:guides/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_CommandService[`CommandService`] (to persist) and to
xref:guides/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_BackgroundCommandService[`BackgroundCommandService`] (to invoke persisted commands in the
background).  If you are using these services then ensure that there are no pending commands at the point at which you
cut-over.  If you have any code that makes assumptions on the format of the XML, it will also need to be rewritten.
Note that the XML which is persisted henceforth is well-defined and any future changes to it will be backward
compatible; see xref:guides/rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_schema[schema reference guide].  In fact, there are three schema: for commands
(`cmd.xsd`), inteactions (`ixn.xsd`) and for changes (`chg.xsd`).  These replace the earlier `aim.xsd` schema (which
was an amalgam of `cmd.xsd` and `ixn.xsd`).

The reworked `CommandService` now properly supports property edits in the exact same way as action invocations.

As a side-effect of this work, note also that:

* the `CommandService#startTransaction(...)` SPI is *NO LONGER CALLED* by the framework.

* the `BackgroundService#asActionInvocationMemento(...)` (not formally part of the API) is also no longer called by the
framework; moreover the default implementation now throws an exception to this effect.


== Auditing

The xref:guides/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_AuditingService[`AuditingService`] SPI service has been deprecated, instead replaced
by the xref:guides/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_AuditerService[`AuditerService`].

There can be more than one implementation of this new SPI, and a framework-provided implementation
(`AuditerServiceLogging`) will log to a file.  The (non-ASF)
http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-audit[Isis addons' audit] module also implements the new SPI.


== Publishing

The xref:guides/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_PublishingService[`PublishingService`] SPI service and its supporting
xref:guides/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_EventSerializer[`EventSerializer`] domain service, have both deprecated, instead
replaced by the xref:guides/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_PublisherService[`PublisherService`].

There can be more than one implementation of this new SPI, and a framework-provided implementation
(`PublisherServiceLogging`) will log to a file.  The (non-ASF)
http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-publishmq[Isis addons' publishmq] module also implements the new SPI.

The new service also supports the notion of published property edits; the new
xref:guides/rgant.adoc#_rgant_Property_publishing[`@Property#publishing()`] annotation attribute can be used to specify.  The `
isis.services.publish.properties` configuration property can be used to specify a fallback default for properties where
the attribute is not set explicitly.

Conversely, neither the xref:guides/rgant.adoc#_rgant_Action_publishingPayloadFactory[`@Action#publishingPayloadFactory()`]
nor the xref:guides/rgant.adoc#_rgant_DomainObject_publishingPayloadFactory[`@DomainObject#publishingPayloadFactory()`] are
supported by `PublisherService`; instead the consumers of the events are expected to callback for any additional
information, eg using xref:guides/ugvro.adoc[Resful Objects] viewer.


== Auto-logout

The new configuration property `isis.authentication.shiro.autoLogoutIfAlreadyAuthenticated` (documented more fully in
the  xref:guides/ugsec.adoc#_ugsec_configuring-isis-to-use-shiro[security guide]) is by default set to false, thereby
disabling auto-logout behaviour that is believed to be the root cause of some exceptions thrown by the
xref:guides/ugvro.adoc#[Restful Objects viewer] during a race condition.  The *previous behaviour can be re-enabled* by setting
to `true`.


== Safe 'rememberMe' cookies

Apache Isis leverages link:http://wicket.apache.org[Apache Wicket]'s rememberMe support which holds remembered
user/passwords in an encrypted cookie.

If a hard-coded and publicly known value were to be used (as was the case prior to `1.13.0`), then it would be
possible for rememberMe user/password to be intercepted and decrypted, possibly compromising access.  The
`isis.viewer.wicket.rememberMe.encryptionKey` configuration property therefore allows a private key to be specified,
baked into the application.

If no value is set then (for safety) a random UUID will be used as the encryption key.  (The net effect of this
fallback behaviour is that 'rememberMe' will work, but only until the webapp is restarted (after which the end-user
will have to log in again).

Related, the `isis.viewer.wicket.suppressRememberMe` configuration property has been replaced by
`isis.viewer.wicket.rememberMe.suppress` (though the old configuration property is still supported).


== Custom programming models

In previous releases the `isis.reflector.facets` configuration property could be used to specify a new implementation
of the (internal) `ProgrammingModel` API.  This configuration property is no longer supported.  See the
xref:guides/ugbtb.adoc#_ugbtb_programming-model_finetuning[beyond the basics] guide for an alternative broadly equivalent
approach.



== injectXxx() no longer supported

Apache Isis automatically injects domain services into other domain objects, supporting the
xref:guides/rgant.adoc#_rgant-Inject[`@Inject`] annotation, also injection to `set...()` setter methods and finally injection
into `inject...()` methods.  This last method is now no longer supported by default.  It can be re-enabled if necessary
using the `isis.services.injector.injectPrefix` configuration property.

It is also possible to disable injection to `set...()` methods (using the `isis.services.injector.setPrefix`
configuration property), though this is enabled by default.

Disabling auto-wiring has a positive impact on bootstrap times, as well as standarding Apache Isis' conventions to be
more in line with JEE.


== Optionally ignore deprecated facets

The `isis.reflector.facets.ignoreDeprecated` configuration property indicates whether to continue to honour or to simply
ignore any deprecated annotations and other semantics that make up the programming model.

This is disabled by default, in other words deprecated facets continue to be recognized.  Be aware that enabling this
setting could substantially alter the semantics of your application.  To be safe, we recommend that you first run the
application using `isis.reflector.validator.allowDeprecated` set to `false`; if any deprecated annotations etc. are
in use, then the app will fail-fast and refuse to start.


== ApplicationFeatureRepository

The `isis.services.applicationFeatures.init` configuration property is used to control whether the
xref:guides/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_ApplicationFeatureRepository[`ApplicationFeatureRepository`] domain service lazily or
eagerly initializes itself based on the framework's internal metamodel.

Previously this service eagerly initialized itself, causing the framework to have to traverse the domain object
model graph for all types, noticeably increasing the bootstrap time.  For `1.13.0` this service now initializes itself
lazily.  The previous behaviour (of eager initialization) can be re-enabled by setting this property to `eager`.



== Integration testing

There are two sets of changes relating to integration tests.

=== Builder

The `IsisSystemForTest.Builder` class is used to xref:guides/ugtst.adoc#_ugtst_integ-test-support_bootstrapping[bootstrap integration tests].

A number of the clauses within this class have been removed:

* `with(PersistenceMechanismInstaller persistenceMechanismInstaller)` +
+
Apache Isis has for many releases only supported a single implementation of persistence mechanism (JDO/DataNucleus),
so this builder method is redundant.

* `with(ProgrammingModel programmingModel)` +
+
Instead, use `AppManifest#getConfiguration()` to xref:guides/ugbtb.adoc#_ugbtb_programming-model_finetuning[include/exclude facets]

* `with(MetaModelValidator metaModelValidator)` +
+
Instead, use `AppManifest#getConfiguration()` to specify a xref:guides/ugbtb.adoc#_ugbtb_programming-model_custom-validator[custom validator].

* `withServicesIn(String... packagePrefixes)` and `withServices(Object... services)` +
+
Instead, use `AppManifest#getAdditionalServices()`

* `withFixtures(InstallableFixture... fixtures)` +
+
Instead, use `AppManifest#getFixtures()`


=== Centralizing configuration

Previously when bootstrapping the integration tests, the `IsisConfigurationForJdoIntegTests` was provided as a custom
implementation of `IsisConfiguration`, providing a number of configuration settings specifically for running
integration tests (eg run using an in-memory database).  This design split the responsiblity of providing the
configuration properties between that class and `AppManifest`.

A new `AppManifest.Util` helper class now allows these responsibilities to belong exlusively to the `AppManifest`.
For example:

[source,java]
----
public class DomainAppSystemInitializer {
    public static void initIsft() {
        IsisSystemForTest isft = IsisSystemForTest.getElseNull();
        if(isft == null) {
            isft = new IsisSystemForTest.Builder()
                    .withLoggingAt(org.apache.log4j.Level.INFO)
                    .with(new DomainAppAppManifest() {
                        @Override
                        public Map<String, String> getConfigurationProperties() {
                            final Map<String, String> map = Maps.newHashMap();
                            Util.withJavaxJdoRunInMemoryProperties(map);
                            Util.withDataNucleusProperties(map);
                            Util.withIsisIntegTestProperties(map);
                            return map;
                        }
                    })
                    .build();
            isft.setUpSystem();
            IsisSystemForTest.set(isft);
        }
    }
}
----


== web.xml

In the xref:guides/ugbtb.adoc#_ugbtb_web-xml[`web.xml`], the "isis.viewers" context-param is now ignored.  Instead the
`viewer_wicket.properties` and `viewer_restfulobjects.properties` will both be loaded if present (but neither need be present).



== `HasTransactionId` mixin

The xref:guides/rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_mixins_HasTransactionId[`HasTransactionId`] mixin interface has subtly changed its
meaning (and is now somewhat mis-named).  Prior to `1.13.0`, this identifier was the GUID of the Isis transaction in
which the object was created.  As of `1.13.0`, this identifier actually is for the request/interaction (as per the new
xref:guides/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_InteractionContext[`InteractionContext`] service) in which the object was created.



== Notable new features

The following are new features so do not impact in themselves impact any migration effort, but you may wish to start
taking advantage of once you have upgraded.

* `@Nullable` annotation +
+
The xref:guides/rgant.adoc#_rgant_Nullable[`@Nullable`] annotation can now be used to specify the optionality of properties
and parameters.

* `ActionDomainEvent` for mixins +
+
Previously it was not possible to discover the mixed-in domain object when an `ActionDomainEvent` was raised by a
mixin action.  This is now possible, through the xref:guides/rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_domainevent_ActionDomainEvent[`mixedIn()`] method.

* `Blob` and `Clob` file types +
+
The xref:guides/rgant.adoc#_rgant_Property_fileAccept[`@Property#fileAccept()`] and
xref:guides/rgant.adoc#_rgant_Parameter_fileAccept[`@Parameter#fileAccept()`] annotation attributes can be used to hint at
the file type to upload for a blob or clob.

* Live reloading +
+
The `isis.viewer.wicket.liveReloadUrl` configuration property allows live reloading of objects if the layout is updated,
reducing feedback times.  Further guidance on setting this up can be found
xref:guides/dg.adoc#_dg_ide_intellij_advanced_gradle-liveReload[here].

* Docker support +
+
The `overrides.properties` configuration file, if present, is loaded last as the configuration property file, with
its contents overriding any previously defined configuration properties.  This simple idea makes it easy to create Docker
container images; see xref:guides/ugbtb.adoc#_ugbtb_deployment_docker[here] for further discussion.
