The `FixtureScriptsSpecificationProvider` SPI service is an alternative to subclassing the xref:guides/rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_super_FixtureScripts[`FixtureScripts`] domain service.  The logic that would normally be in the subclass moves to the provider service instead, and the framework instantiates a fallback default instance, xref:guides/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_FixtureScriptsDefault[`FixtureScriptsDefault`].

This new design is optional; if you continue to provide your own subclass then everything will continue as before.  However the new design is more flexible and involves less code.

See xref:guides/ugtst.adoc#_ugtst_fixture-scripts_api-and-usage[user guide] for further discussion.
