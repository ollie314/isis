As discussed in xref:guides/ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_getting-started_simpleapp-archetype[SimpleApp archetype] and elsewhere, the `org.apache.isis.WebServer` provides the ability to run your app from an embedded jetty.  This is great for prototyping.  The class resides in the `isis-core-webserver` module, which also has the dependency on jetty.

In 1.9.0 we have upgraded the jetty dependency to use Jetty 9.2.0 (`org.eclipse.jetty.aggregate:jetty-all:9.2.11.v20150529`, to be precise).  One consequence of this is that the packaged WAR file will not boot on Tomcat.

One fix is to simply remove the `isis-core-webserver` module as a dependency of your webapp module, however this will prevent you from using our `org.apache.isis.WebServer` launcher.  That's not necessarily a bad thing; you could continue to use `jetty:run`, say.  But it might be a change to your development workflow that you don't want.

Alternatively you can change your webapp's `pom.xml` so that when the war is packaged up it excludes the jetty files.  To do this, locate the `maven-war-plugin` module definition (under `<build>/<plugins>` and add to its `<configuration>` section:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    <artifactId>maven-war-plugin</artifactId>
    <configuration>
        ...
        <packagingExcludes>
            WEB-INF/lib/isis-core-webserver*.jar,
            WEB-INF/lib/javax.servlet-api-*.jar,
            WEB-INF/lib/javax.websocket-api-*.jar,
            WEB-INF/lib/jetty-all-*.jar
        </packagingExcludes>
    </configuration>
</plugin>

For future projects the xref:guides/ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_getting-started_simpleapp-archetype[SimpleApp archetype] has been updated with this change.
