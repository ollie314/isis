CommApp is an application whose domain is that of managing businesses themselves, specifically the commercial aspects
of a business.  You can get a feel for it from this screenshot:

which shows how the app integrates a number of the (non-ASF) link:http://isisaddons.org[Isis Addons]
(http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-excel[excel],
http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-fullcalendar2[fullcalendar2] and
http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-gmap3[gmap3]).  The app also uses the
(non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-wickedcharts[wickedcharts] module to generate various charts.

== Why Apache Isis?

When making our decision towards a software development framework, we evaluated some few like Spring Framework and
Oracle ADF, including a newer semantic framework.  At that point we faced we needed to choose between being locked in
to a framework using many of their proprietary classes, methods and other features, or having to write a lot of code
even to get things as CURD operations, and we would be facing significant differences in the code if using relational
databases or the newer so called NonSQL databases.

So we added Apache Isis to our evaluation, and we found it to be open in many aspects, including an open architecture
and auto-generated UI viewer, as well as equally open and auto-generated REST/SOA web services, seamlessly support
both SQL and NoSQL through an open and standard http://datanucleus.org[persistence manager], as well as open security
(http://shiro.apache.org[Apache Shiro], LDAP) and features such as multi-tenancy.

Our main focus in the code is given to the business domain, with business logic treated as a first class citizen.
And because our code simply uses non-proprietary Java, we've been able to extend it the normal way.  Very little code in
our application so far can be considered to be framework-specific, the few that is only because we chose to use some
of the (non-ASF) link:http://isisaddons.org[Isis Addons] that provide our applications with high value, and which are
open source also.

When creating our prototype and then subsequent application, we've found quite amazing support: most of the time the
Isis team provides same day high quality support, with samples and references, which has helped us find the solution
to our needs quickly.  The framework is growing rapidly as well, keeping its openness and business domain driven focus.
The tutorials and documentation is quite comprehensive and very clear.  We have found all this hard to find in many
other open source frameworks.
