TransportPlanner is a demo done by link:http://www.sintef.no/home/MARINTEK/[Marintek AS] to show a possible 'solution' to a multimodal transport planning problem. It's a small part of a bigger European funded project.

The domain is that:

-  some cargo should be transported from a pickup destination to a delivery destination.
-  A 'client' creates a transport demand
-  A 'logistics service provider' plans a route from pickup to delivery using a shortest path algorithm.
-  The route's waypoints (where cargo is loaded from one providere to another) may be shown on a map.
-  The costs associated with each leg may be shown as a pie chart
- The resource usage, i.e. costs and time for each leg, may be shown as a bar chart.
-  An event may be generated (e.g. some customs papers are missing, therefore transport execution stops and a replan
is necessary).

|TransportPlanner allows schedules of journeys to be planned.  It uses the (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-wicket-gmap3[Isis addons' gmap3] wicket extension to provide the map.

The author, Christian Steinebach, wrote this demo part-time over the course of a few weeks.  He commented:

pass:[<div class="extended-quote"><p>]
I did not have too much time to get 'something done' ... But although I had a hard time in the beginning with Isis I don't think I would have made it in time using 'conventional' development with database, GUI etc.
using Apache Isis.
pass:[</p></div>]

Because this is a demo, there is a lot of room for improvement, but it does show how a relatively simple domain model can be brought 'alive'. The source code is available link:https://www.assembla.com/code/transportplanner/git/nodes[here] (note: it was written against a snapshot version of Apache Isis).
