The process for merging in github pull requests (so that they can be tested locally before committing) has been scripted in the `github-pr.sh` script.

The script will merge the fork into a temporary branch, and then run a build.  Once you are happy, you can commit.

The script requires `jq` to parse JSON; see the section below on installing pre-requisites.



== Process and Usage

The overall process is as follows:

* locate/raise corresponding JIRA ticket, eg ISIS-1162
* checkout branch from which PR was forked (usually just 'master')
* merge PR into temporary branch using the `github-pr.sh` script
* test the change locally (run the app, rebuild, manual regression tests etc)
* if required, tidy up/refactor code as required
* merge temporary branch into mainline, and commit


For example:

[source,bash]
----
github-pr.sh isis 1162 31
----

where:

* `isis` is the JIRA project and repo
* `1162` is the JIRA ticket number
* `31`   is the gthub PR issue number




== Example transcript

The listing below shows the steps taken by the script:

[source,bash]
----
$ sh github-pr.sh isis 1162 31

Found JIRA ticket
Found github PR
branch_name_local: master
username         : sebadiaz
repo_full_name   : sebadiaz/isis
repo_clone_url   : https://github.com/sebadiaz/isis.git
branch_name_fork : master

merging into: ISIS-1162_pr-31

Merged the PR; hit enter to build
----

The build now commences.  Once done, the script continues:

[source,bash]
----
If build successful and happy to merge, execute:

git checkout master && git merge --no-ff ISIS-1162_pr-31 && git branch -d ISIS-1162_pr-31
----

The screenshot belows shows the history we end up with:

image::{_imagesdir}committers/github-pr-history.png[link="{_imagesdir}committers/github-pr-history.png"]

This shows the fork being merged into the temporary branch ("ISIS-1162_pr-31"), then some further tidy-up, and finally the merging of the temporary branch into mainline.

Note that there is no rebasing in this model.  This is intentional: when the merged branch is pushed, github will automatically close the original pull request.
