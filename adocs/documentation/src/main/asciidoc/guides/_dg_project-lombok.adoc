link:https://projectlombok.org/[Project Lombok] is an open source project to reduce the amount of boilerplate in
your code.

For example, rather than write:

[source,java]
----
private String name;
public String getName() {
    return name;
}
public void setName(String name) {
    this.name = name;
}
----

you can instead write simply:

[source,java]
----
@Getter @Setter
private String name;
----

Under the covers it is implemented as an annotation processor; it basically hooks into the Java compiler
so that it can emit additional bytecode (eg for the getter and setter).  See xref:_cg_ide_intellij_other-settings-compiler[here] for details of setting up in IntelliJ (Eclipse has very similar support).

Apache Isis supports link:https://projectlombok.org/[Project Lombok], in that the annotations that would normally be placed on the getter (namely xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Property[`Property`], xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-PropertyLayout[`@PropertyLayout`], xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Collection[`@Collection`], xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-CollectionLayout[`@CollectionLayout`] and xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-MemberOrder[`@MemberOrder`]) can be placed on the field instead.


There are plugins for Lombok for maven; it's just a matter of adding the required dependency.  To compile the code
within your IDE (eg so that its compiler "knows" that there is, actually, a getter and setter) will require an
Lombok plugin appropriate to that IDE.  See the link:https://projectlombok.org/download.html[Lombok download page] for more information.



== Future thoughts

In the future we might extend/fork Lombok so that it understands Isis' own annotations (ie xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Property[`@Property`] and xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Collection[`@Collection`])
rather than Lombok's own `@Getter` and `@Setter.

It might also be possible to use Lombok to generate the domain event classes for each member.
