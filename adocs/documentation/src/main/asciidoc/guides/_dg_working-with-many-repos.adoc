Applications built with Apache Isis often (should) consist of multiple modules, each in separate git repositories.  For example, there are the various (non-ASF) link:http://isisaddons.org[Isis Addons] that provide various cross-cutting concerns/technical services (security, mail-merge etc), as well the modules eg as provided by the (non-ASF) link:http://catalog.incode.org[Incode Catalog], which provides generic business subdomains (communication channels, documents etc).

In addition, your own application may well be structured as a number of distinct modules (probably with the entities in each module being mapped to a different schema), and using such techniques as the xref:ugbtb.adoc#_ugbtb_decoupling_event-bus[event bus] and xref:ugbtb.adoc#_ugbtb_decoupling_mixins[mixins] so that these modules are decoupled from each other.

All of which is a preamble to say that you will likely have multiple directories on your local development computer, for each such git repository that you contribute to.

In this appendix we provide some simple but useful bash scripts to help you manage each such.


== Prerequisites

We recommend that you adopt a convention for your directories.  For example, open source repositories (such as the Isis Addons and Incode Catalog mentioned above) reside in link:https://github.com/[github.com], while your own proprietary code might reside in some other service, eg link:https://bitbucket.org/[bitbucket].  For example:

[source]
----
/users/home/me/
    BITBUCKET/
        mycompany/
            myapp-moduleA
            myapp-moduleB
            myapp
    GITHUB/
        isisaddons/
            isis-module-docx
            isis-module-security
        incodehq/
            incode-module-commchannel
            incode-module-classification
----


== `_repos.txt`

Create a file `_repos.txt` that catalogues the repositories, eg:

[source]
----
#
# our code
#
/users/home/me/BITBUCKET/mycompany/myapp-moduleA
/users/home/me/BITBUCKET/mycompany/myapp-moduleB
/users/home/me/BITBUCKET/mycompany/myapp
#
# open source modules
#
/users/home/me/GITHUB/isisaddons/isis-module-docx
/users/home/me/GITHUB/isisaddons/isis-module-security
/users/home/me/GITHUB/incodehq/incode-module-commchannel
/users/home/me/GITHUB/incodehq/incode-module-classification
----


== Bash functions

The `.bash_functions` file (downloadable from this link:https://gist.github.com/danhaywood/21b5b885433fd8bc440da3fab88c91cb[gist]) provides the following two functions:


* `repo` +
+
Switches (using `pushd`) to the specified directory (as listed in the `_repos.txt` file).

* `foreach` +
+
Runs the specified command for all (or matching) repositories (as listed in `_repos.txt` file).


For example,

[source,bash]
----
repo doc
----

would switch to `/users/home/me/GITHUB/isisaddons/isis-module-docx`, the first module that matches the fragment.


Meanwhile:

[source,bash]
----
foreach git status
----

would perform a `git status` on every git repository, while

[source,bash]
----
foreach -g isisaddons git fetch
----

would perform a `git fetch` but only to those repositories which match "isisaddons" (`-g` flag standing for `grep`).


To load the functions into your profile (`.bashrc` or `.profile` or similar), use:

[source,bash]
----
. ~/.bash_functions
----
