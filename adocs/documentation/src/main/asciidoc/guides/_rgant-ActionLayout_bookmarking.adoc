The `bookmarking()` attribute indicates if an action (with safe xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Action_semantics[action semantics]) is automatically bookmarked. This attribute is also supported for  xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainObjectLayout_bookmarking[domain objects].



In the xref:ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer], a link to a bookmarked object is shown in the bookmarks panel:

image::{_imagesdir}reference-annotations/ActionLayout/bookmarking.png[width="720px",link="{_imagesdir}reference-annotations/ActionLayout/bookmarking.png"]

[NOTE]
====
Note that this screenshot shows an earlier version of the xref:ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] UI (specifically, pre 1.8.0).
====

[TIP]
====
The xref:ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] supports `alt-[` as a shortcut for opening the bookmark panel.  `Esc` will close.
====


For example:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItems {
    @Action(semantics=SemanticsOf.SAFE)
    @ActionLayout(bookmarking=BookmarkPolicy.AS_ROOT)
    @MemberOrder(sequence = "1")
    public List<ToDoItem> notYetComplete() {
        ...
    }
}
----

indicates that the `notYetComplete()` action is bookmarkable.



[NOTE]
====
The enum value `AS_CHILD` has no meaning for actions; it relates only to bookmarked xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainObject_bookmarking[domain object]s.
====



As an alternative to using the annotation, the dynamic xref:ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_object-layout_dynamic[`.layout.json`]
can be used instead, eg:

[source,javascript]
----
"notYetComplete": {
    "actionLayout": { "bookmarking": "AS_ROOT" }
}
----
