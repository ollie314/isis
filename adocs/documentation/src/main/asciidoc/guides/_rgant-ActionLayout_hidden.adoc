The `hidden()` attribute indicates where (in the UI) the action should be hidden from the user.  This attribute can also be applied to xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-PropertyLayout_hidden[properties] and xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-CollectionLayout_hidden[collections].

[TIP]
====
It is also possible to use xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Action_hidden[`@Action#hidden()`] to hide an action at the domain layer.  Both options are provided with a view that in the future the view-layer semantics may be under the control of (expert) users, whereas domain-layer semantics should never be overridden or modified by the user.
====

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    @ActionLayout(hidden=Where.EVERYWHERE)
    public void updateStatus() { ... }
    ...
}
----

The acceptable values for the `where` parameter are:

* `Where.EVERYWHERE` or `Where.ANYWHERE` +
+
The action should be hidden at all times.

* `Where.NOWHERE` +
+
The action should not be hidden.


The other values of the `Where` enum have no meaning for a collection.


As an alternative to using the annotation, the dynamic xref:ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_object-layout_dynamic[`.layout.json`]
can be used instead, eg:

[source,javascript]
----
"updateStatus": {
    "actionLayout": { "hidden": "EVERYWHERE" }
}
----


[NOTE]
====
For actions of domain services the visibility is dependent upon its xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainService_nature[`@DomainService#nature()`] and also on whether it is contributed (as per  xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-ActionLayout_contributedAs[`@ActionLayout#contributedAs()`]).
