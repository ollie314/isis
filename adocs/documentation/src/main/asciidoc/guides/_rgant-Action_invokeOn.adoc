The `invokeOn()` attribute indicates whether the an action can be invoked on a single object (the default) and/or on many objects in a collection.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem {
    @Action(invokeOn=InvokeOn.OBJECT_AND_COLLECTION)
    public void markAsCompleted() {
        setCompleted(true);
    }
    ...
}
----


Actions to be invoked on collection (currently) have a number of constraints.  It:

* must take no arguments
* cannot be hidden (any annotations or supporting methods to that effect will be ignored)
* cannot be disabled (any annotations or supporting methods to that effect will be ignored).

The example given above is probably ok, because `setCompleted()` is most likely idempotent. However, if the action also called some other method, then we should add a guard.

For example, for this non-idempotent action:

[source,java]
----
@Action(invokeOn=InvokeOn.OBJECT_AND_COLLECTION)
public void markAsCompleted() {
    setCompleted(true);
    todoTotalizer.incrementNumberCompleted();
}
----

we should instead write it as:

[source,java]
----
@Action(invokeOn=InvokeOn.OBJECT_AND_COLLECTION)
public void markAsCompleted() {
    if(isCompleted()) {
        return;
    }
    setCompleted(true);
    todoTotalizer.incrementNumberCompleted();
}
----

[NOTE]
====
This attribute has no meaning if annotated on an action of a domain service.
