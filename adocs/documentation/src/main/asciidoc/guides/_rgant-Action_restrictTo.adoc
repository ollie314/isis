By default actions are available irrespective of the xref:rgcfg.adoc#_rgcfg_deployment-types[deployment mode].  The `restrictTo()` attribute specifies whether the action should instead be restricted to only available in prototyping mode.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    public Order placeNewOrder() { ... }
    public List<Order> listRecentOrders() { ... }

    @Action(restrictTo=RestrictTo.PROTOTYPING)
    public List<Order> listAllOrders() { ... }
    ...
}
----

In this case the listing of all orders (in the `listAllOrders()` action) probably doesn't make sense for production; there could be thousands or millions.  However, it would be useful to disaply how for a test or demo system where there are only a handful of orders.
