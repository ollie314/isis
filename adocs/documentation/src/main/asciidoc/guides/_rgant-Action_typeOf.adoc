The `typeOf()` attribute specifies the expected type of an element returned by the action (returning a collection), when for whatever reason the type cannot be inferred from the generic type, or to provide a hint about the actual run-time (as opposed to compile-time) type.  This attribute can also be specified for xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Collection_typeOf[collections].


For example:

[source,java]
----
public void AccountService {
    @Action(typeOf=Customer.class)
    public List errantAccounts() {
        return customers.allNewCustomers();
    }
    ...

    @Inject
    CustomerRepository customers;
}
----

[TIP]
====
In general we recommend that you use generics instead, eg `List<Customer>`.
