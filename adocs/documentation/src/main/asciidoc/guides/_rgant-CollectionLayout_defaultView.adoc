The xref:ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] allows additional views to be configured to render collections of objects; at the time of writing thesee include the (non-ASF) (non-ASF) link:http://isisaddons.org[Isis Addons]' (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-wicket-excel[excel] view, the http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-wicket-fullcalendar2[fullcalendar2] view, and the http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-wicket-gmap3[gmap3] view.  If the objects to be rendered have the correct "shape", then the appropriate view will be made available.  For example, objects with a date can be rendered using `calendar`; objects with locations can be rendered using `map`.

The `defaultView()` attribute is used to select which of these views should be used by default for a given collection.


For example:

[source,java]
----
public class BusRoute {
    @CollectionLayout(
        defaultView="map"
    )
    public SortedSet<BusStop> getStops() { ... }
    ...
}
----


As an alternative to using the annotation, the dynamic xref:ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_object-layout_dynamic[`.layout.json`]
can be used instead, eg:

[source,javascript]
----
"dependencies": {
    "collectionLayout": {
        "defaultView": "map"
    }
}
----

[NOTE]
====
This attribute takes precedence over any value for the xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-CollectionLayout_render[`@CollectionLayout#render()`] attribute.  For example, if the
`defaultView` attribute is defined to "table", then the table will be show even if `render` is set to `LAZILY`.
