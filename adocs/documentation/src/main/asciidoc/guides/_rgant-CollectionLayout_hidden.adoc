The `hidden()` attribute indicates where (in the UI) the collection should be hidden from the user.  This attribute can also be applied to xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-ActionLayout_hidden[actions] and xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-PropertyLayout_hidden[properties].


[TIP]
====
It is also possible to use xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Collection_hidden[`@Collection#hidden()`] to hide an action at the domain layer.  Both options are provided with a view that in the future the view-layer semantics may be under the control of (expert) users, whereas domain-layer semantics should never be overridden or modified by the user.
====

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem {
    @CollectionLayout(
        hidden=Where.EVERYWHERE
    public SortedSet<ToDoItem> getDependencies() { ... }
    ...
}
----


The acceptable values for the `where` parameter are:

* `Where.EVERYWHERE` or `Where.ANYWHERE` +
+
The collection should be hidden everywhere.

* `Where.ANYWHERE` +
+
Synonym for everywhere.

* `Where.OBJECT_FORMS` +
+
The collection should be hidden when displayed within an object form.

* `Where.NOWHERE` +
+
The collection should not be hidden.

The other values of the `Where` enum have no meaning for a collection.


As an alternative to using the annotation, the dynamic xref:ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_object-layout_dynamic[`.layout.json`]
can be used instead, eg:

[source,javascript]
----
"dependencies": {
    "collectionLayout": { "hidden": "EVERYWHERE" }
}
----
