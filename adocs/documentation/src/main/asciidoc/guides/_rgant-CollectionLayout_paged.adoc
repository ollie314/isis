The `paged()` attribute specifies the number of rows to display in a (parented) collection. This attribute can also be applied to xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainObjectLayout_paged[domain objects] and xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-ViewModelLayout_paged[view models].


[WARNING]
====
The xref:ugvro.adoc#[RestfulObjects viewer] currently does not support paging.   The xref:ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] _does_ support paging, but note that the paging is performed client-side rather than server-side.

We therefore recommend that large collections should instead be modelled as actions (to allow filtering to be applied to limit the number of rows).
====


For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Order {
    @CollectionLayout(paged=15)
    public SortedSet<OrderLine> getDetails() {...}
}
----


It is also possible to specify a global default for the page size of standalone collections, using the xref:rgcfg.adoc#_rgcfg_configuring-core[configuration property] `isis.viewer.paged.parented`.



As an alternative to using the annotation, the dynamic xref:ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_object-layout_dynamic[`.layout.json`]
can be used instead, eg:

[source,javascript]
----
"details": {
    "collectionLayout": {
        "paged": 15
    }
}
----
