The `sortedBy()` attribute specifies that the collection be ordered using the specified comparator, rather than the natural ordering of the entity (as would usually be the case).

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem implements Comparable<ToDoItem> {      // <1>
    public static class DependenciesComparator               // <2>
            implements Comparator<ToDoItem> {
        @Override
        public int compare(ToDoItem p, ToDoItem q) {
            return ORDERING_BY_DESCRIPTION                   // <3>
                    .compound(Ordering.<ToDoItem>natural())
                    .compare(p, q);
        }
    }
    @CollectionLayout(sortedBy=DependenciesComparator.class) // <4>
    public SortedSet<ToDoItem> getDependencies() { ... }
    ...
}
----
<1> the class has a natural ordering (implementation not shown)
<2> declaration of the comparator class
<3> ordering defined as being by the object's `description` property (not shown), and then by the natural ordering of the class
<4> specify the comparator to use

When the `dependencies` collection is rendered, the elements are sorted by the `description` property first:

[NOTE]
====
Note that this screenshot shows an earlier version of the xref:ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] UI (specifically, pre 1.8.0).
====


Without this annotation, the order would have been inverted (because the natural ordering places items not completed before those items that have been completed.




As an alternative to using the annotation, the dynamic xref:ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_object-layout_dynamic[`.layout.json`]
can be used instead, eg:

[source,javascript]
----
"dependencies": {
    "collectionLayout": {
        "sortedBy": "com.mycompany.myapp.dom.ToDoItem.DependenciesComparator"
    }
}
