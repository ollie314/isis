The `editing()` annotation indicates whether a collection can be added to or removed from within the UI.  This attribute can also be specified for xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Property_editing[properties], and can also be specified for the xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainObject_editing[domain object]

The related `editingDisabledReason()` attribute specifies the a hard-coded reason why the collection cannot be modified directly.

[WARNING]
====
The xref:ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] does *not* currently support the modification of collections; they are rendered read-only.

The workaround is to create add/remove actions and use xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-MemberOrder[UI hints] to render them close to the collection.
====

Whether a collection is enabled or disabled depends upon these factors:

* whether the domain object has been configured as immutable through the xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainObject_editing[`@DomainObject#editing()`] attribute

* else (that is, if the domain object's editability is specified as being `AS_CONFIGURED`), then the value of the xref:rgcfg.adoc#_rgcfg_configuring-core[configuration property] `isis.objects.editing`.  If set to `false`, then the object's collections (and properties) are *not* editable

* else, then the value of the `@Collection(editing=...)` attribute itself.

* else, the result of invoking any supporting xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_methods_prefixes_disable[`disable...()`] supporting methods


Thus, to make a collection read-only even if the object would otherwise be editable, use:


[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem {
    @Collection(
        editing=Editing.DISABLED,
        editingDisabledReason="Use the add and remove actions to modify"
    )
    public SortedSet<ToDoItem> getDependencies() { ... }
}
----

[NOTE]
====
To reiterate, it is _not_ possible to enable editing for a collection if editing has been disabled at the object-level.
