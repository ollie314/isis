The `@javax.jdo.annotation.Discriminator` is used by JDO/DataNucleus to specify how to discriminate between subclasses of an inheritance hierarchy.

It is valid to add a `@Discriminator` for any class, even those not part of an explicitly mapped inheritance hierarchy.  Apache Isis also checks for this annotation, and if present will use the `@Discriminator#value()` as the object type, a unique alias for the object's class name.

[NOTE]
====
Isis parses the `@Discriminator` annotation from the Java source code; it does not query the JDO metamodel.  This means that it the `@Discriminator` annotation must be used rather than the equivalent `<discriminator>` link:http://www.datanucleus.org/products/accessplatform_4_0/jdo/orm/inheritance.html[XML metadata].

Moreover, while JDO/DataNucleus will recognize annotations on either the field or the getter method, Apache Isis (currently) only inspects the getter method.  Therefore ensure that the annotation is placed there.
====

The object type is used internally by Apache Isis to generate a string representation of an objects identity (the `Oid`).  This can appear in several contexts, including:

* as the value of `o.a.i.applib.services.bookmark.Bookmark#getObjectType()`
* in the `toString()` value of `Bookmark`
* in the URLs of the xref:ugvro.adoc#[RestfulObjects viewer]
* in the URLs of the xref:ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] (in general and in particular if xref:ugvw.adoc#_ugvw_features_hints-and-copy-url[copying URLs])
* in XML snapshots generated by the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_XmlSnapshotService[`XmlSnapshotService`]


For example:

[source,java]
----
@javax.jdo.annotations.Discriminator(value="custmgmt.Customer")
public class Customer {
    ...
}
----

has an object type of `custmgmt.Customer`.

If the object type has not been specified, then Apache Isis will use the fully qualified class name of the entity.



[TIP]
====
This might be obvious, but to make explicit: we recommend that you use namespaces of some form or other.

If the object type has not been specified (by either this annotation, or by xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-PersistenceCapable[`@PersistenceCapable`], or by Apache Isis' own xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainObject_objectType[`@DomainObject#objectType()`] annotation/attribute), then (as noted above) Apache Isis will use the fully qualified class name of the entity.

However, chances are that the fully qualified class name is liable to change over time, for example if the code is refactored or (more fundamentally) if your company/organization reorganizes/renames itself/is acquired.

We therefore strongly recommend that you specify an object type for all entities, one way or another.  Specifying `@Discriminator` will override `@PersistenceCapable`, which overrides `@DomainObject#objectType()`.  Using `@PersistenceCapable#schema()` is probably the best choice in most cases.
====

[NOTE]
====
If the object type is not unique across all domain classes then the framework will fail-fast and fail to boot.  An error message will be printed in the log to help you determine which classes have duplicate object tyoes.
