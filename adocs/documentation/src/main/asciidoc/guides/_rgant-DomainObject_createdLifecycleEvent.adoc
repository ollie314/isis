Whenever a domain object is instantiated or otherwise becomes known to the framework, a "created" lifecycle event is fired.  This is typically when the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_DomainObjectContainer[`DomainObjectContainer`]'s xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_DomainObjectContainer_object-creation-api[`newTransientInstance()`] is called;
it will also happen if the object is simply instantiated with `new(...)`, and then the container's
xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_DomainObjectContainer_services-api[`injectServicesInto(...)`] method is called.

Subscribers subscribe through the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_EventBusService[`EventBusService`] and can
use the event to obtain a reference to the object just created.  The subscriber could then, for example, update the
object, eg looking up state from some external datastore.


By default the event raised is `ObjectCreatedEvent.Default`. For example:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObject
public class ToDoItemDto {
    ...
}
----

The purpose of the `createdLifecycleEvent()` attribute is to allows a custom subclass to be emitted instead.  A similar
attribute is available for other lifecycle events.

For example:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObjectLayout(
    createdLifecycleEvent=ToDoItem.CreatedEvent.class
)
public class ToDoItem {
    public static class CreatedEvent
        extends org.apache.isis.applib.services.eventbus.ObjectCreatedEvent<ToDoItem> { }
    ...
}
----

The benefit is that subscribers can be more targeted as to the events that they subscribe to.




== Subscribers

Subscribers (which must be domain services) subscribe using either the link:https://github.com/google/guava[Guava] API
or (if the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_EventBusService[`EventBusService`] has been appropriately configured)
using the link:http://www.axonframework.org/[Axon Framework] API.  The examples below use the Guava API.

Subscribers can be either coarse-grained (if they subscribe to the top-level event type):

[source,java]
----
@DomainService(nature=NatureOfService.DOMAIN)
public class SomeSubscriber extends AbstractSubscriber {
    @com.google.common.eventbus.Subscribe
    public void on(ObjectCreatedEvent ev) {
        if(ev.getSource() instanceof ToDoItem) { ... }
    }
}
----

or can be fine-grained (by subscribing to specific event subtypes):

[source,java]
----
@DomainService(nature=NatureOfService.DOMAIN)
public class SomeSubscriber extends AbstractSubscriber {
    @com.google.common.eventbus.Subscribe
    public void on(ToDoItem.ObjectCreatedEvent ev) {
        ...
    }
}
----


[TIP]
====
If the AxonFramework is being used, replace `@com.google.common.eventbus.Subscribe` with `@org.axonframework.eventhandling.annotation.EventHandler`.

== Default, Doop and Noop events

If the `createdLifecycleEvent` attribute is not explicitly specified (is left as its default value, `ObjectCreatedEvent.Default`),
then the framework will, by default, post an event.

If this is not required, then the `isis.reflector.facet.domainObjectAnnotation.createdLifecycleEvent.postForDefault`
configuration property can be set to "false"; this will disable posting.

On the other hand, if the `createdLifecycleEvent` has been explicitly specified to some subclass, then an event will be posted.
The framework provides `ObjectCreatedEvent.Doop` as such a subclass, so setting the `createdLifecycleEvent` attribute to this class
will ensure that the event to be posted, irrespective of the configuration property setting.

And, conversely, the framework also provides `ObjectCreatedEvent.Noop`; if `createdLifecycleEvent` attribute is set to this class,
then no event will be posted.
