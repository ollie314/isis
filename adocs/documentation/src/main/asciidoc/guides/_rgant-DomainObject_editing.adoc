The `editing()` attribute determines whether a domain object's properties and collections are not editable (are read-only).

The default is `AS_CONFIGURED`, meaning that the xref:rgcfg.adoc#_rgcfg_configuring-core[configuration property] `isis.objects.editing` is used to determine the whether the object is modifiable:

* `true` +
+
the object's properties and collections are modifiable.

* `false` +
+
the object's properties and collections are read-only, ie _not_ modifiable.

If there is no configuration property in `isis.properties` then object are assumed to be modifiable.

[TIP]
====
In other words, editing can be disabled globally for an application by setting:

[source,ini]
----
isis.objects.editing=false
----

We recommend enabling this feature; it will help drive out the underlying business operations (processes and procedures) that require objects to change; these can then be captured as business actions.
====

The related `editingDisabledReason()` attribute specifies the a hard-coded reason why the object's properties and collections cannot be modified directly.



This default can be overridden on an object-by-object basis; if `editing()` is set to `ENABLED` then the object's properties and collections are editable irrespective of the configured value; if set to `DISABLED` then the object's properties and collections are not editable irrespective of the configured value.

For example:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObject(
    editing=Editing.DISABLED,
    editingDisabledReason="Reference data, so cannot be modified"
)
public class Country {
    ...
}
----

[TIP]
====
Another interesting example of immutable reference data is to define an entity to represent individual dates; after all, for a system with an expected lifetime of 20 years that equates to only 7,300 days, a comparatively tiny number of rows to hold in a database.
