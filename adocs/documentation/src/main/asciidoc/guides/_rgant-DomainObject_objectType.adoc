The `objectType()` attribute is used to provide a unique alias for the object's class name.

This value is used internally to generate a string representation of an objects identity (the `Oid`).  This can appear in several contexts, including:

* as the value of `o.a.i.applib.services.bookmark.Bookmark#getObjectType()`
* in the `toString()` value of `Bookmark`
* in the URLs of the xref:ugvro.adoc#[RestfulObjects viewer]
* in the URLs of the xref:ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] (in general and in particular if xref:ugvw.adoc#_ugvw_features_hints-and-copy-url[copying URLs])
* in XML snapshots generated by the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_XmlSnapshotService[`XmlSnapshotService`]


For example:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObject(
    objectType="ORD"
)
public class Order {
    ...
}
----

If the object type has not been specified, then Apache Isis will use the fully qualified class name of the entity.


[TIP]
====
This might be obvious, but to make explicit: we recommend that you use namespaces of some form or other for object types.

As noted above, if the object type has not been specified, then Apache Isis will use the fully qualified class name of the entity.  However, this is liable to change over time, for example if the code is refactored or (more fundamentally) if your company/organization reorganizes/renames itself/is acquired.

We therefore strongly recommend that you specify an object type for all entities, either using `objectType()` or using the JDO xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-PersistenceCapable[`@PersistenceCapable`] (with a `schema()` attribute) or xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Discriminator[`@Discriminator`] annotations.  Specifying `@Discriminator` will override `@PersistenceCapable`, which in turn overrides `objectType()`.  Using `@PersistenceCapable#schema()` is probably the best choice in most cases.

[NOTE]
====
If the object type is not unique across all domain classes then the framework will fail-fast and fail to boot.  An error message will be printed in the log to help you determine which classes have duplicate object tyoes.
