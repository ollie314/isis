The `publishing()` attribute determines whether and how a modified object instance is published via the registered
implementation of a xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_PublishingService[`PublishingService`]) or
xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_PublisherService[`PublisherService`].  This attribute is also supported
for xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Action_publishing[actions], where it controls whether action invocations are published as
events, and for xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant_Property_publishing[`@Property#publishing()`], where it controls whether
property edits are published as events.

A common use case is to notify external "downstream" systems of changes in the state of the Isis application.

The default value for the attribute is `AS_CONFIGURED`, meaning that the xref:rgcfg.adoc#_rgcfg_configuring-core[configuration property] `isis.services.publish.objects` is used to determine the whether the action is published:

* `all` +
+
all changed objects are published

* `none` +
+
no changed objects are published

If there is no configuration property in `isis.properties` then publishing is automatically enabled for domain objects.

This default can be overridden on an object-by-object basis; if `publishing()` is set to `ENABLED` then changed instances of the domain class are published irrespective of the configured value; if set to `DISABLED` then the changed instances are _not_ published, again irrespective of the configured value.

For example:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObject(
    publishing=Publishing.ENABLED  // <1>
)
public class InterestRate {
    ...
}
----
<1> because set to enabled, will be published irrespective of the configured value.




== `publishingPayloadFactory()`

The (optional) related `publishingPayloadFactory()` specifies the class to use to create the (payload of the) event to
be published by the publishing factory.

Rather than simply broadcast that the object was changed, the payload factory allows a "fatter" payload to be
instantiated that can eagerly push commonly-required information to all subscribers. For at least some subscribers
this should avoid the necessity to query back for additional information.


[WARNING]
====
Be aware that this attribute is only honoured by the (deprecated)
xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_PublishingService[`PublishingService`], so should itself be considered as deprecated.  It
is ignored by the replacement xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_PublisherService[`PublisherService`],
