The `named()` attribute explicitly specifies the domain service's name, overriding the name that would normally be inferred from the Java source code.  This attribute can also be specified for xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-ActionLayout_named[actions], xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-CollectionLayout_named[collections], xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-PropertyLayout_named[properties], xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-ParameterLayout_named[parameters], xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainObjectLayout_named[domain objects] and xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-ViewModelLayout_named[view models].


[TIP]
====
The value of this attribute also has an important role to play in the positioning of the domain service's actions relative to the actions of other domain services.  See xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainServiceLayout_menuOrder[`menuOrder()`] for a full discussion with examples.

For example:

[source,java]
----
@DomainService
@DomainServiceLayout(
    named="Customers"
)
public class CustomerRepository {
   ...
}
----
