The `@HomePage` annotation allows a _single_ (no-arg, query-only) action on a _single_ domain service to be nominated as the action to invoke for the default home page.  This often returns a view model that acts as some sort of dashboard, presenting key information and makeing the most commonly used actions easy to invoke.

For example, the (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-app-todoapp[Isis addons' todoapp] uses `@HomePage` to return a dashboard of todo items to complete:

image::{_imagesdir}reference-annotations/HomePage/HomePage.png[width="800px",link="{_imagesdir}reference-annotations/HomePage/HomePage.png"]


The corresponding code is:

[source,java]
----
@DomainService(nature = NatureOfService.DOMAIN)
public class ToDoAppDashboardService  {
    @Action(
            semantics = SemanticsOf.SAFE
    )
    @HomePage
    public ToDoAppDashboard lookup() {
        return container.injectServicesInto(new ToDoAppDashboard());
    }
    @Inject
    private DomainObjectContainer container;
}
----

where `ToDoAppDashboard` is:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObject(nature = Nature.VIEW_MODEL)
public class ToDoAppDashboard {
    public String title() { return "Dashboard"; }

    public List<ToDoItem> getNotYetComplete() { ... }
    public List<ToDoItem> getComplete() { ... }

    public Blob exportToWordDoc() { ... }  // <1>
}
----
<1> associated using xref:ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_object-layout_dynamic[dynamic layouts] with the `notYetComplete` collection.

The other two actions shown in the above screenshot -- `exportAsXml` and `downloadLayout` -- are actually contributed to the `ToDoAppDashboard` through various domain services, as is the `downloadLayout` action.
