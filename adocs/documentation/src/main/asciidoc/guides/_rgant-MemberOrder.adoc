The `@MemberOrder` annotation is used to specify the relative order of domain object members, that is: properties, collections and actions.  It works in conjunction with the xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-MemberGroupLayout[`@MemberGroupLayout`] annotation.

The annotation defines four attributes:

* `columnSpans()` -- of type `int[]` -- which specifies the relative column sizes of the three columns that render properties as well as a fourth column that renders only collections

* `left()` -- of type `String[]` - that specifies the order of the property groups (inferred from `@MemberOrder#name()`) as applied to properties) in the left-most column

* `middle()` -- of type `String[]` - that specifies the order of the property groups (if any) as applied to properties) in the middle column

* `right()` -- of type `String[]` - that specifies the order of the property groups (if any) as applied to properties) in the right-most column

Collections are always rendered in the "last" column.  This can appear either below the columns holding properties (if their column spans = 12), or can be rendered to the right of the property columns (if the spans of the property columns come to <12 leaving enough room for the span of the collection column).

[IMPORTANT]
====
As this is an important topic, there is a xref:ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_object-layout[separate chapter] that discussed object layout in full.

[TIP]
====
The annotation is one of a handful (others including xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Collection[`@Collection`], xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-CollectionLayout[`@CollectionLayout`], xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Property[`@Property`])
 and xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-PropertyLayout[`@PropertyLayout`] that can also be applied to the field, rather than the getter method.  This is specifically
so that boilerplate-busting tools such as link:https://projectlombok.org/[Project Lombok] can be used.
