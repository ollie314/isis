The `@Mixin` annotation indicates that the class acts as a mixin, contributing behaviour -
actions, (derived) properties and (derived) collections - to another domain object.

For example:

[source,java]
----
@Mixin
public class DocumentHolder_documents {
    private final DocumentHolder holder;
    public DocumentHolder_documents(DocumentHolder holder) {
        this.holder = holder;
    }
    @Action(semantics=SemanticsOf.SAFE)
    @ActionLayout(contributed = Contributed.AS_ASSOCIATION)
    @CollectionLayout(render = RenderType.EAGERLY)
    public List<Document> documents() {
        ...                                                     // <1>
    }
}
----
<1> for example, using the (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-poly[Isis addons' poly] module.


An alternative and equivalent approach is to use the
xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainObject_nature[`@DomainObject#nature()`] annotation with a nature of `MIXIN`.


For further discussion on using mixins, see xref:ugbtb.adoc#_ugbtb_decoupling_mixins[mixins] in the user guide.
