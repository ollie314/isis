Apache Isis' defaults for properties and parameters is that they are mandatory unless otherwise stated.  The
`@javax.annotation.Nullable` annotation is recognized by Apache Isis for both properties and
parameters as means to indicate that the property/parameter is not mandatory.


For example:

[source,java]
----
@javax.annotation.Nullable
public String getName() {
    return name;
}
public void setName(final String name) {
    this.name = name;
}
----

or:

[source,java]
----
public Customer updateName(@javax.annotation.Nullable final String name) {
    setName(name);
    return this;
}
----

Apache Isis does provide several other ways to specify optionality: using the
xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant_Property_optionality[`@Property#optionality()`] /
xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant_Parameter_optionality[`@Parameter#optionality()`] annotation.  For properties, the optionality
can also be inferred from the xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant_Column_allowsNull[`@Column#allowsNull()`] attribute.

[TIP]
====
See the
xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant_Property_optionality[`@Property#optionality()`] documentation for a much fuller discussion on
the relationship between using the Apache Isis annotations vs
xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant_Column_allowsNull[`@Column#allowsNull()`].
====

If more than one method is specified then the framework will validate that there are no incompatibilities (and fail to
boot otherwise).  This can also be verified using the xref:rgmvn.adoc#_rgmvn_validate[validate goal] of the Apache
Isis Maven plugin.
