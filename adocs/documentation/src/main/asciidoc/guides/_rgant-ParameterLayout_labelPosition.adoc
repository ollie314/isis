The `labelPosition()` attribute determines the positioning of labels for parameters.  This attribute can also be specified for xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-PropertyLayout_labelPosition[properties].

The positioning of labels is typically `LEFT`, but can be positioned to the `TOP`.  The one exception is xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-ParameterLayout_multiLine[`multiLine()`] string parameters, where the label defaults to `TOP` automatically (to provide as much real-estate for the multiline text field as possible).

For boolean parameters a positioning of `RIGHT` is also allowed; this is ignored for all other types.

It is also possible to suppress the label altogether, using `NONE`.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Order {
    public Order changeStatus(
                    OrderStatus newStatus
                    @Parameter(
                        optionality=Optionality.OPTIONAL
                    )
                    @ParameterLayout(
                        named="Reason",
                        labelPosition=LabelPosition.TOP
                    )
                    String reason) {
        ...
    }
    ...
}
