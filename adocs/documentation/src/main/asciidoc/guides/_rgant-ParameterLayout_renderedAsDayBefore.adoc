The `renderedAsDayBefore()` attribute applies only to date parameters whereby the date will be rendered as the day before the value actually held in the domain object.  It is ignored for parameters of other types.  This attribute is also supported for xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-PropertyLayout_renderedAsDayBefore[properties].

This behaviour might at first glance appear odd, but the rationale is to support the use case of a sequence of instances that represent adjacent intervals of time.  In such cases there would typically be `startDate` and `endDate` properties, eg for all of Q2.  Storing this as a half-closed interval -- eg `[1-Apr-2015, 1-July-2015)` -- can substantially simplify internal algorithms; the `endDate` of one interval will correspond to the `startDate` of the next.

However, from an end-user perspective the requirement may be to render the interval as a fully closed interval; eg the end date should be shown as `30-Jun-2015`.

This attribute therefore bridges the gap; it presents the information in a way that makes sense to an end-user, but also stores the domain object in a way that is easy work with internally.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Tenancy {
    public void changeDates(
        @ParameterLayout(named="Start Date")
        LocalDate startDate,
        @ParameterLayout(
            named="End Date",
            renderedAsDayBefore=true
        )
        LocalDate endDate) {
        ...
    }
}
