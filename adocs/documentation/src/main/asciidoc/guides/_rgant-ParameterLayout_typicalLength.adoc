The `typicalLength()` attribute indicates the typical length of a string parameter.  It is ignored for parameters of other types.  The attribute is also supported for xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-PropertyLayout_typicalLength[properties].

The information is intended as a hint to the UI to determine the space that should be given to render a particular string parameter.  That said, note that the xref:ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] uses the maximum space available for all fields, so in effect ignores this attribute.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    public Customer updateName(
                @Parameter(maxLength=30)
                @ParameterLayout(
                    named="First name",
                    typicalLength=20
                )
                final String firstName,
                @Parameter(maxLength=30)
                @ParameterLayout(
                    named="Last name",
                    typicalLength=20
                )
                final String lastName) {
        ...
    }
    ...
}
