The `maxLength()` attribute applies only to `String` parameters, indicating the maximum number of characters that the user may enter (for example in a text field in the UI).  It is ignored if applied to parameters of any other type.  This attribute can also be applied to xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Property_maxLength[properties].

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class CustomerRepository {
    public Customer newCustomer(
        @Parameter(maxLength=30)
        @ParameterLayout(named="First Name")  // <1>
        final String firstName,
        @Parameter(maxLength=50)
        @ParameterLayout(named="Last Name")
        final String lastName) {
        ...
    }
}
----
<1> the `@ParameterLayout(named=...)` attribute is required for Java 7; for Java 8 it can be omitted if the (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-metamodel-paraname8[Isis addons' paraname8] metamodel extension is used.
