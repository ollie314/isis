The `@javax.annotation.PostConstruct` annotation, as defined in link:https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=250[JSR-250],  is recognized by Apache Isis as a callback method on domain services to be called just after they have been constructed, in order that they initialize themselves.

It is also recognized for xref:ugbtb.adoc#_ugbtb_view-models[view models] (eg annotated with xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-ViewModel[`@ViewModel`]).

For the default application-scoped (singleton) domain services, this means that the method, if present, is called during the bootstrapping of the application.  For xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-RequestScoped[`@RequestScoped`] domain services, the method is called at the beginning of the request.

The signature of the method is:

[source,java]
----
@PostConstruct                 <1>
public void init() { ... }     <2>
----
<1> It is not necessary to annotate the method with xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Programmatic[`@Programmatic`]; it will be automatically excluded from the Apache Isis metamodel.
<2> the method can have any name, but must have `public` visibility.

In the form shown above the method accepts no arguments.  Alternatively - for domain services only, not view models - the method can accept a parameter of type `Map<String,String>`:

[source,java]
----
@PostConstruct
@Programmatic
public void init(Map<String,String> properties) { ... }
----
Isis uses argument to pass in the configuration properties read from all xref:rgcfg.adoc#_rgcfg_configuration-files[configuration files]:

[TIP]
====
Alternatively, you could inject xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_DomainObjectContainer[`DomainObjectContainer`] into the service and read configuration properties using `DomainObjectContainer#getProperty(...)` and related methods.  Note that when using this latter API only those configuration properties prefixes `application.` key are provided.
====

A common use case is for domain services that interact with the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_EventBusService[`EventBusService`].  For example:

[source,java]
----
@DomainService(nature=NatureOfService.DOMAIN)
public class MySubscribingService {
    @PostConstruct
    public void postConstruct() {
        eventBusService.register(this);
    }
    @PreDestroy
    public void preDestroy() {
        eventBusService.unregister(this);
    }
    ...
    @javax.inject.Inject
    EventBusService eventBusService;
}
----

[TIP]
====
In this particular use case, it is generally simpler to just subclass from xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_super_AbstractSubscriber[`AbstractSubscriber`].
====


Other use cases include obtaining connections to external datasources, eg subscribing to an ActiveMQ router, say, or initializing/cleaning up a background scheduler such as Quartz.
