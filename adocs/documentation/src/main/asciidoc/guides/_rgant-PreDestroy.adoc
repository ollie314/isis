The `@javax.annotation.PreDestroy` annotation, as defined in link:https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=250[JSR-250], recognized by Apache Isis as a callback method on domain services to be called just as they go out of scope.


For the default application-scoped (singleton) domain services, this means that the method, if present, is called just prior to the termination of the application.  For xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-RequestScoped[`@RequestScoped`] domain services, the method is called at the end of the request.

The signature of the method is:

[source,java]
----
@PreDestroy                         <1>
public void deinit() { ... }    <2>
----
<1> It is not necessary to annotate the method with xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Programmatic[`@Programmatic`]; it will be automatically excluded from the Apache Isis metamodel.
<2> the method can have any name, but must have `public` visibility, and accept no arguments.

A common use case is for domain services that interact with the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_EventBusService[`EventBusService`].  For example:

[source,java]
----
@DomainService(nature=NatureOfService.DOMAIN)
public class MySubscribingService {
    @PostConstruct
    public void init() {
        eventBusService.register(this);
    }
    @PreDestroy
    public void deinit() {
        eventBusService.unregister(this);
    }
    ...
    @javax.inject.Inject
    EventBusService eventBusService;
}
----

[TIP]
====
In this particular use case, it is generally simpler to just subclass from xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_super_AbstractSubscriber[`AbstractSubscriber`].
====

Other use cases include obtaining connections to external datasources, eg subscribing to an ActiveMQ router, say, or initializing/cleaning up a background scheduler such as Quartz.
