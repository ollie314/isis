The `@Programmatic` annotation causes the method to be excluded completely from the Apache Isis metamodel. This means it won't appear in any UI, and it won't appear in any xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_MementoService[memento]s or xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_XmlSnapshotService[snapshot]s.

A common use-case is to ignore implementation-level artifacts. For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer implements Comparable<Customer> {
    ...
    @Programmatic
    public int compareTo(Customer c) {
        return getSalary() - c.getSalary();
    }
    ...
}
----


Note that `@Programmatic` does not simply imply `@Hidden`; it actually means that the class member will not be part of the Apache Isis metamodel.
