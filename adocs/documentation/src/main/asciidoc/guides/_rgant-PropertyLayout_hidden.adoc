The `hidden()` attribute indicates where (in the UI) the property should be hidden from the user.  This attribute can also be applied to xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Action_hidden[actions] and xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Collection_hidden[collections].

[TIP]
====
It is also possible to use xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-PropertyLayout_hidden[`@PropertyLayout#hidden()`] or xref:ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_object-layout_dynamic[dynamic layouts] such that the property can be hidden at the view layer. Both options are provided with a view that in the future the view-layer semantics may be under the control of (expert) users, whereas domain-layer semantics should never be overridden or modified by the user.
====


For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    @PropertyLayout(
        hidden=Where.ALL_TABLES
    )
    public int getInternalId() { ... }
    ...
}
----

The acceptable values for the `where` parameter are:

* `Where.EVERYWHERE` or `Where.ANYWHERE` +
+
The property should be hidden everywhere.

* `Where.ANYWHERE` +
+
Synonym for everywhere.

* `Where.OBJECT_FORMS` +
+
The property should be hidden when displayed within an object form.

* `Where.PARENTED_TABLES` +
+
The property should be hidden when displayed as a column of a table within a parent object's collection.

* `Where.STANDALONE_TABLES` +
+
The property should be hidden when displayed as a column of a table showing a standalone list of objects, for example as returned by a repository query.

* `Where.ALL_TABLES` +
+
The property should be hidden when displayed as a column of a table, either an object's * collection or a standalone list. This combines `PARENTED_TABLES` and `STANDALONE_TABLES`.

* `Where.NOWHERE` +
+
The property should not be hidden, overriding any other metadata/conventions that would normally cause the property to be hidden. +

For example, if a property is annotated with xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Title[`@Title`], then normally this should be hidden from all
tables. Annotating with `@Property(where=Where.NOWHERE)` overrides this.


[NOTE]
====
The xref:ugvro.adoc#[RestfulObjects viewer] has only partial support for these `Where` enums.

As an alternative to using the annotation, the dynamic xref:ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_object-layout_dynamic[`.layout.json`]
can be used instead, eg:

[source,javascript]
----
"internalId": {
    "propertyLayout": { "hidden": "ALL_TABLES" }
}
