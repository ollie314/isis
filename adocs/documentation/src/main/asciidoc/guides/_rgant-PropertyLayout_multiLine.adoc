The `multiLine()` attribute specifies that the text field for a string property should span multiple lines.  It is ignored for other property types.  The attribute is also supported for xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-ParameterLayout_multiLine[parameters].

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class BugReport {
    @PropertyLayout(
        numberOfLines=10
    )
    public String getStepsToReproduce() { ... }
    public void setStepsToReproduce(String stepsToReproduce) { ... }
    ...
}
----

Here the `stepsToReproduce` will be displayed in a text area of 10 rows.



As an alternative to using the annotation, the dynamic xref:ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_object-layout_dynamic[`.layout.json`]
can be used instead, eg:

[source,javascript]
----
"stepsToReproduce": {
    "propertyLayout": {
        "numberOfLines": 10
    }
}
----


[NOTE]
====
If set > 1 (as would normally be the case), then the default xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-PropertyLayout_labelPosition[`labelPosition`] defaults to `TOP` (rather than `LEFT`, as would normally be the case).
