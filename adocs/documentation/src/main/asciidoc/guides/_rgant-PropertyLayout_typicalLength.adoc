The `typicalLength()` attribute indicates the typical length of a string property.  It is ignored for properties of other types.  The attribute is also supported for xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-ParameterLayout_typicalLength[parameters].

The information is intended as a hint to the UI to determine the space that should be given to render a particular string property.  That said, note that the xref:ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] uses the maximum space available for all fields, so in effect ignores this attribute.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    @javax.jdo.annotations.Column(length=30)
    @ParameterLayout(typicalLength=20)
    public String getFirstName() { ... }
    public void setFirstName(String firstName) { ... }
    ...
}
----
