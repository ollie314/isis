The `maxLength()` attribute applies only to `String` properties, indicating the maximum number of characters that the user may enter (for example in a text field in the UI).  The attribute It is ignored if applied to properties of any other type.  This attribute can also be applied to xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Parameter_maxLength[parameters].


That said, properties are most commonly defined on persistent domain objects (entities), in which case the JDO xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Column[`@Column`] will in any case need to be specified.  Apache Isis can infer the `maxLength` semantic directly from the equivalent `@Column#length()` annotation/attribute.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    @javax.jdo.annotations.Column(length=30)
    public String getFirstName() { ... }
    public void setFirstName(String firstName) { ... }
    ...
}
----

In this case there is therefore no need for the `@Property#maxLength()` attribute.



== Non-persistent properties

Of course, not every property is persistent (it could instead be derived), and neither is every domain object an entity (it could be a view model).  For these non persistable properties the `maxLength()` attribute is still required.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    @javax.jdo.annotation.NotPersistent                    // <1>
    @Property(maxLength=100)
    public String getFullName() { ... }                    // <2>
    public void setFullName(String fullName) { ... }       // <3>
    ...
}
----
<1> a non persisted (derived) property
<2> implementation would most likely derive full name from constituent parts (eg first name, middle initial, last name)
<3> implementation would most likely parse the input and update the constituent parts
