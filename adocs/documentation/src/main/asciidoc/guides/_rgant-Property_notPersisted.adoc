The (somewhat misnamed) `notPersisted()` attribute indicates that the collection should be excluded from any snapshots generated by the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_XmlSnapshotService[`XmlSnapshotService`].  This attribute is also supported for xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Collection_notPersisted[collections].


[WARNING]
====
This annotation does _not_ specify that a property is not persisted in the JDO/DataNucleus objectstore.  See below for details as to how to additionally annotate the property for this.
====


For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Order {
    @Property(notPersisted=true)
    public Order getPreviousOrder() {...}
    public void setPreviousOrder(Order previousOrder) {...}
    ...
}
----

Historically this annotation also hinted as to whether the property's value contents should be persisted in the object store.  However, the JDO/DataNucleus objectstore does not recognize this annotation.  Thus, to ensure that a property is actually not persisted, it should *also* be annotated with `@javax.jdo.annotations.NotPersistent`.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Order {
    @Property(notPersisted=true)               // <1>
    @javax.jdo.annotations.NotPersistent       // <2>
    public Order getPreviousOrder() {...}
    public void setPreviousOrder(Order previousOrder) {...}
    ...
}
----
<1> ignored by Apache Isis
<2> ignored by JDO/DataNucleus





Alternatively, if the property is derived, then providing only a "getter" will also work:

[source,java]
----
public class Order {
    public Order getPreviousOrder() {...}
    ...
}
----
