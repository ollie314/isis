There are three attributes related to enforcing regular expressions:

* The `regexPattern()` attribute validates the contents of any string property with respect to a regular expression pattern. It is ignored if applied to properties of any other type. This attribute can also be specified for xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Parameter_regexPattern[parameters].

* The `regexPatternFlags()` attribute specifies flags that modify the handling of the pattern.  The values are those
that would normally be passed to `java.util.regex.Pattern#compile(String,int)`.

* The related `regexPatternReplacement()` attribute specifies the error message to show if
the provided argument does not match the regex pattern.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    @Property(
        regexPattern = "(\\w+\\.)*\\w+@(\\w+\\.)+[A-Za-z]+",
        regexPatternFlags=Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE,
        regexPatternReplacement = "Must be valid email address (containing a '@') symbol"   // <1>
    )
    public String getEmail() { ... }
}
----
<1> Note that there is currently no i18n support for this phrase.
