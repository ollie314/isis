The `@javax.enterprise.context.RequestScoped` link:https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=299[JSR-299] CDI annotation is used to specify that a xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainService[domain service] should be request-scoped rather than a singleton.

Although Apache Isis does not (currently) leverage CDI, the semantics are the same as request-scoped service; a new instance is created for each HTTP request, reserved for the exclusive use of all objects interacted with during that request.

One of the built-in domain services that uses this annotation is xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_Scratchpad[`Scratchpad`], intended to allow the arbitrary sharing of data between objects.  Here is the full source code of this service is:


[source,java]
----
@DomainService(
        nature = NatureOfService.DOMAIN
)
@RequestScoped
public class Scratchpad {
    private final Map<Object, Object> userData = Maps.newHashMap();   // <1>
    @Programmatic
    public Object get(Object key) {
        return userData.get(key);                                     // <2>
    }
    @Programmatic
    public void put(Object key, Object value) {
        userData.put(key, value);                                     // <3>
    }
    @Programmatic
    public void clear() {
        userData.clear();                                             // <4>
    }
}
----
<1> Provides a mechanism for each object being acted upon to pass data to the next object.
<2> Obtain user-data, as set by a previous object being acted upon.
<3> Set user-data, for the use of a subsequent object being acted upon.
<4> Clear any user data.


The vast majority of domain services in Apache Isis tend to be singletons (which requires no special annotation); but as you can see setting up request-scoped services is very straightforward.

[NOTE]
====
Behind the covers Apache Isis creates a (singleton) wrapper for the domain service; the individual request-scoped instances are held in a thread-local of this wrapper.  One consequence of this implementation is that request-scoped methods should not be marked as `final`.
