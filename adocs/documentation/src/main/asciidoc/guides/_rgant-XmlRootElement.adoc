The `@XmlRootElement` annotation provides an alternative way to define a
xref:rg.adoc#_ugbtb_view-models[view model], in particular one intended to act as a DTO for use within
xref:ugvro.adoc#[RestfulObjects viewer], or which contains arbitrarily complex state.

A view model is a non-persisted domain object whose state is converted to/from a string memento.  In the case of a
JAXB-annotated object this memento is its XML representation.  JAXB generally requires that the root element of the
XML representation is annotated with `@XmlRootElement`.  Apache Isis makes this a mandatory requirement.

In comparison to using either the xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_super_ViewModel[`ViewModel`] interface or the
xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-ViewModel[`@ViewModel`] annotation, using `@XmlRootElement` has a couple of
significant advantages:

* the view model can be used as a "canonical" DTO, for example when accessing data using the
xref:ugvro.adoc#[RestfulObjects viewer] in combination with the
xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_ContentMappingService[`ContentMappingService`]. +
+
This provides a stable and
versioned API to access data in XML format using whatever client-side technology may be appropriate.

* the XML graph can be as deep as required; in particular it can contain collections of other objects. +
+
In contrast, if the `@ViewModel` annotation is used then only the state of the properties (not collections) is captured.
If using `ViewModel` interface then arbitrary state (including that of collections), however the programmer must write
all the code by hand

The main disadvantages of using JAXB-annotated view models is that any referenced persistent entity must be annotated
with the xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-XmlJavaTypeAdapter[`@XmlJavaTypeAdapter`], using the
framework-provided `PersistentEntityAdapter`.  This adapter converts any references to such domain entities using the
`oidDto` complex type (as defined by the Apache Isis xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_schema-common[common schema]):
the object's type and its identifier.

[TIP]
====
The memento string for view models is converted into a form compatible with use within a URL.  This is performed by the
xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_UrlEncodingService[`UrlEncodingService`], the default implementation of which
simply encodes to base 64.  If the view model XML graph is too large to be serialized to a string, then an alternative
implementation (eg which maps XML strings to a GUID, say) can be configured using the technique described in
xref:rg.adoc#_ugfun_how-tos_replacing-default-service-implementations[here] in the user guide.

== Example

This example is taken from the (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-app-todoapp[Isis addons' todoapp]:

[source,java]
----
@XmlRootElement(name = "toDoItemDto")           // <1>
public class ToDoItemDto implements Dto {
    @Getter @Setter                             // <2>
    protected String description;
    @Getter @Setter
    protected String category;
    @Getter @Setter
    protected String subcategory;
    @Getter @Setter
    protected BigDecimal cost;
}
----
<1> identifies this class as a view model and defines the root element for JAXB serialization
<2> using Project Lombok for getters and setters

Although (like any other viewmodel) a JAXB-annotated can have behaviour (actions) and UI hints, you may wish to keep
the DTO "clean", just focused on specifying the data contract.

Behaviour can therefore be provided using xref:ugbtb.adoc#_ugbtb_decoupling_mixins[mixins] (annotated with
xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Mixin[`@Mixin`]), while xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_uievent[UI events] can be used
to obtain title, icons and so on.

in the user guide.
