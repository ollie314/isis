When running an Apache Isis webapp, configuration properties are read from configuration files held in the `WEB-INF` directory.

The `WEBINF/isis.properties` file is always read and must exist.

In addition, the following other properties are searched for and if present also read:

* `viewer_wicket.properties` - if the xref:ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] is in use

* `viewer_restfulobjects.properties` - if the xref:ugvro.adoc#[RestfulObjects viewer] is in use

* `viewer.properties` - for any other viewer configuration (but there are none currently)

* `persistor_datanucleus.properties` - assuming the JDO/DataNucleus objectstore is in use

* `persistor.properties` - for any other objectstore configuration.  +
+
This typically is used to hold `JDBC` ``URL``s, which is arguably a slight violation of the file (because there's nothing in Apache Isis to say that persistors have to use `JDBC`.  However, it is generally convenient to put these `JDBC` settings into a single location.  If you want, they could reside inin any of `persistor_datanucleus.properties`, `persistor.properties` or (even) `isis.properties`

* `authentication_shiro.properties`, `authorization_shiro.properties`
+
assuming the Shiro Security is in use (but there are no security-related config properties currently; use shiro.ini for Shiro config)

* `authentication.properties`, `authorization.properties` +
+
for any other security-related config properties (but there are none currently).

You can if you wish simply store all properties in the `isis.properties` file; but we think that breaking properties out into sections is preferable.
