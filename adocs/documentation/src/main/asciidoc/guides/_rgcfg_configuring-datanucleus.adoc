Apache Isis programmatically configures DataNucleus; any Apache Isis properties with the prefix `isis.persistor.datanucleus.impl` are passed through directly to the JDO/DataNucleus objectstore (with the prefix stripped off, of course).

DataNucleus will for itself also and read the `META-INF/persistence.xml`; at a minimum this defines the name of the "persistence unit".  n theory it could also hold mappings, though in Apache Isis we tend to use annotations instead.

Furthermore, DataNucleus will search for various other XML mapping files, eg `mappings.jdo`.  A full list can be found http://www.datanucleus.org/products/datanucleus/jdo/metadata.html[here].  The metadata in these XML can be used to override the annotations of annotated entities; see xref:ugbtb.adoc#_ugbtb_other-techniques_overriding-jdo-annotations[Overriding JDO Annotatons] for further discussion.
