By default, JDO/DataNucleus supports the concept of http://www.datanucleus.org/products/datanucleus/jdo/orm/cascading.html[persistence-by-reachability]. That is, if
a non-persistent entity is associated with an already-persistent entity, then DataNucleus will detect this and will automatically persist the associated object. Put another way: there is no need to call Apache Isis' `DomainObjectContainer#persist(.)` or `DomainObjectContainer#persistIfNotAlready(.)` methods.

However, convenient though this feature is, you may find that it causes performance issues.

[WARNING]
====
DataNucleus' persistence-by-reachability may cause performance issues.  We strongly recommend that you disable it.
====

One scenario in particular where this performance issues can arise is if your entities implement the `java.lang.Comparable` interface, and you have used Apache Isis' xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_utility_ObjectContracts[`ObjectContracts`] utility class. The issue here is that `ObjectContracts` implementation can cause DataNucleus to recursively rehydrate a larger number of associated entities. (More detail below).

We therefore recommend that you disable persistence-by-reachability by adding the following to `persistor_datanucleus.properties`:

[source,ini]
----
isis.persistor.datanucleus.impl.datanucleus.persistenceByReachabilityAtCommit=false
----

This change has been made to the xref:ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_getting-started_simpleapp-archetype[SimpleApp archetype]

If you do disable this feature, then you will (of course) need to ensure that you explicitly persist all entities using the `DomainObjectContainer#persist(.)` or `DomainObjectContainer#persistIfNotAlready(.)` methods.





== The issue in more detail

Consider these entities (http://yuml.me/edit/b8681268[yuml.me/b8681268]):

In the course of a transaction, the `Agreement` entity is loaded into memory (not necessarily modified), and then new ``AgreementRole``s are associated to it.

All these entities implement `Comparable` using `ObjectContracts`, and the implementation of ``AgreementRole``'s (simplified) is:

[source,java]
----
public class AgreementRole {
    ...
    public int compareTo(AgreementRole other) {
        return ObjectContracts.compareTo(this, other, "agreement","startDate","party");
    }
}
----

while ``Agreement``'s is implemented as:

[source,java]
----
public class Agreement {
    ...
    public int compareTo(Agreement other) {
        return ObjectContracts.compareTo(this, other, "reference");
    }
}
----

and ``Party``'s is similarly implemented as:

[source,java]
----
public class Party {
    ...
    public int compareTo(Party other) {
        return ObjectContracts.compareTo(this, other, "reference");
    }
}
----

DataNucleus's persistence-by-reachability algorithm adds the `AgreementRole` instances into a `SortedSet`, which causes `AgreementRole#compareTo()` to fire:

* the evaluation of the "agreement" property delegates back to the `Agreement`, whose own `Agreement#compareTo()` uses the scalar `reference` property. As the `Agreement` is already in-memory, this does not trigger any further database queries

* the evaluation of the "startDate" property is just a scalar property of the `AgreementRole`, so will already in-memory

* the evaluation of the "party" property delegates back to the `Party`, whose own `Party#compareTo()` requires the uses the scalar `reference` property. However, since the `Party` is not yet in-memory, using the `reference` property triggers a database query to "rehydrate" the `Party` instance.

In other words, in figuring out whether `AgreementRole` requires the persistence-by-reachability algorithm to run, it causes the adjacent associated entity `Party` to also be retrieved.
