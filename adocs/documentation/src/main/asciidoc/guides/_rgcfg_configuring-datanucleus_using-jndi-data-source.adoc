Isis' JDO objectstore can be configured either to connect to the database using its own connection pool, or by using a container-managed datasource.



== Application managed

Using a connection pool managed directly by the application (that is, by Apache Isis' JDO objectstore and ultimately by DataNucleus) requires a single set of configuration properties to be specified.

In the `WEB-INF\persistor_datanucleus.properties` file, specify the connection driver, url, username and password.

For example:

[source,ini]
----
isis.persistor.datanucleus.impl.javax.jdo.option.ConnectionDriverName=net.sf.log4jdbc.DriverSpy
isis.persistor.datanucleus.impl.javax.jdo.option.ConnectionURL=jdbc:log4jdbc:hsqldb:mem:test
isis.persistor.datanucleus.impl.javax.jdo.option.ConnectionUserName=sa
isis.persistor.datanucleus.impl.javax.jdo.option.ConnectionPassword=
----

Those configuration properties that start with the prefix `isis.persistor.datanucleus.impl.` are passed through directly to DataNucleus (with the prefix removed).





== Container managed (JNDI)

Using a datasource managed by the servlet container requires three separate bits of configuration.

Firstly, specify the name of the datasource in the `WEB-INF\persistor_datanucleus.properties` file. For example:

If connection pool settings are also present in this file, they will simply be ignored. Any other configuration properties that start with the prefix `isis.persistor.datanucleus.impl.` are passed through directly to DataNucleus (with the prefix removed).

Secondly, in the `WEB-INF/web.xml`, declare the resource reference:

[source,xml]
----
<resource-ref>
    <description>db</description>
    <res-ref-name>jdbc/simpleapp</res-ref-name>
    <res-type>javax.sql.DataSource</res-type>
    <res-auth>Container</res-auth>
</resource-ref>
----

Finally, declare the datasource as required by the servlet container. For example, if using Tomcat 7, the datasource can be specified by adding the following to `$TOMCAT_HOME/conf/context.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<Resource name="jdbc/simpleapp"
  auth="Container"
  type="javax.sql.DataSource"
  maxActive="100"
  maxIdle="30"
  maxWait="10000"
  username="sa"
  password="p4ssword"
  driverClassName="com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver"
  url="jdbc:sqlserver://127.0.0.1:1433;instance=.;databaseName=simpleapp"/>
----

You will also need to make sure that the JDBC driver is on the servlet container's classpath. For Tomcat, this means copying the driver to `$TOMCAT_HOME/lib`.

[NOTE]
====
According to Tomcat's documentation, it is supposedly possible to copy the `conf/context.xml` to the name of the webapp, eg `conf/mywebapp.xml`, and scope the connection to that webapp only.  I was unable to get this working, however.
