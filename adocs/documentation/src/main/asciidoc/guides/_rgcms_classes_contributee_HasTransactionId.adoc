The `HasTransactionId` interface is a mix-in for any domain objects that reference a transaction id, such as
auditing entries or commands, or for xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_InteractionContext[``Interaction``]s persisted as
published events.

[NOTE]
====
Prior to `1.13.0`, this identifier was the GUID of the Isis transaction in which the object was created (hence the
name).  As of `1.13.0`, this identifier actually is for the request/interaction in which the object was created, so is
actually now mis-named.
====

The interface is defined is:

[source,java]
----
public interface HasTransactionId {
    public UUID getTransactionId();                             // <1>
    public void setTransactionId(final UUID transactionId);
}
----
<1> unique identifier (a GUID) of this request/interaction.
