Subclass of xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_domainevent_AbstractDomainEvent[`AbstractDomainEvent`] for collections.

The class has a couple of responsibilities (in addition to those it inherits):

* capture the target object being interacted with

* indicate whether the interaction is to add or remove an object from the collection (or simply to indicate that the collection is being accessed/read)

* capture the object reference being added or removed


The class itself is instantiated automatically by the framework whenever interacting with a rendered object's collection.


== API

The API of the class is:

[source,java]
----
public abstract class CollectionDomainEvent<S,T> extends AbstractDomainEvent<S> {

    public static class Default                                 // <1>
        extends CollectionDomainEvent<Object, Object> { ... }
    public static class Noop                                    // <2>
        extends CollectionDomainEvent<Object, Object> { ... }
    public static class Doop                                    // <3>
        extends CollectionDomainEvent<Object, Object> { ... }

    public T getValue();                                        // <4>
    public Of getOf();                                          // <5>
}
----
<1> The `Default` nested static class is the default for the xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant_Collection_domainEvent[`@Collection#domainEvent()`]
annotation attribute.  Whether this raises an event or not depends upon the
`isis.reflector.facet.collectionAnnotation.domainEvent.postForDefault` configuration property.
<2> The `Noop` class is provided as a convenience to indicate that an event should _not_ be posted (irrespective of the configuration property setting).
<3> Similarly, the `Doop` class is provided as a convenience to indicate that an event _should_ be raised (irrespective of the configuration property setting).
<4> the object being added or removed
<5> whether this is to add or to remove

where the `Of` enum indicates in turn how the collection is being interacted with:

[source,java]
----
public static enum Of {
    ACCESS,         // <1>
    ADD_TO,         // <2>
    REMOVE_FROM     // <3>
}
----
<1> collection is being rendered; set during for hide and disable phases
<2> collection is being added to; set for validate, executing and executed phases
<3> or, collection is being removed from; set for validate, executing and executed phases
