Subclass of xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_domainevent_AbstractDomainEvent[`AbstractDomainEvent`] for properties.

The class has a couple of responsibilities (in addition to those it inherits):

* capture the target object being interacted with

* capture the old and new values of the property


The class itself is instantiated automatically by the framework whenever interacting with a rendered object's property.


== API

The API of the class is:

[source,java]
----
public abstract class PropertyDomainEvent<S,T> extends AbstractDomainEvent<S> {

    public static class Default                                 // <1>
        extends PropertyDomainEvent<Object, Object> { ... }
    public static class Noop                                    // <2>
        extends PropertyDomainEvent<Object, Object> { ... }
    public static class Doop                                    // <3>
        extends PropertyDomainEvent<Object, Object> { ... }

    public T getOldValue();                                     // <4>
    public T getNewValue();                                     // <5>
}
----
<1> The `Default` nested static class is the default for the xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant_Property_domainEvent[`@Property#domainEvent()`]
annotation attribute.  Whether this raises an event or not depends upon the
`isis.reflector.facet.propertyAnnotation.domainEvent.postForDefault` configuration property.
<2> The `Noop` class is provided as a convenience to indicate that an event should _not_ be posted (irrespective of the configuration property setting).
<3> Similarly, the `Doop` class is provided as a convenience to indicate that an event _should_ be raised (irrespective of the configuration property setting).
<4> The pre-modification value of the property; populated at validate and subsequent phases.
<5> The proposed (post-modification) value of the property; populated at validate and subsequent phases
