Subclass of xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_lifecycleevent_AbstractLifecycleEvent[`AbstractLifecycleEvent`], broadcast
when an object is about to be saved (inserted) into the database using the
xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_DomainObjectContainer_object-persistence-api[`DomainObjectContainer`]'s
`#persist(...)` method.


`ObjectPersistingEvent.Default` is the concrete implementation that is used.

[NOTE]
====
In the future this may be generalized to allow arbitrary subclasses to be broadcast, see ISIS-803.
