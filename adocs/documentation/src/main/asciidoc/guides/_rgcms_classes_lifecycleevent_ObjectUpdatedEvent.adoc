Subclass of xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_lifecycleevent_AbstractLifecycleEvent[`AbstractLifecycleEvent`], broadcast
when an object has just been updated in the database.  This is done either explicitly when the current
transaction is flushed using the
xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_DomainObjectContainer_object-persistence-api[`DomainObjectContainer`]'s
`#flush(...)` method, else is done implicitly when the transaction commits at the end of the user request.

`ObjectUpdatedEvent.Default` is the concrete implementation that is used.

[NOTE]
====
In the future this may be generalized to allow arbitrary subclasses to be broadcast, see ISIS-803.
