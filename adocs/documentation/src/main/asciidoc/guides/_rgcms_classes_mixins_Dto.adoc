The `Dto` role interface is intended to be implemented by JAXB-annotated view models, that is, annotated using
xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-XmlRootElement[`@XmlRootElement`].  It enables the ability to download the XML and
XSD schema of those objects using two xref:ugbtb.adoc#_ugbtb_decoupling_mixins[mixins],
`Dto_downloadXml` and `Dto_downloadXsd`.

The interface is just a marker interface (with no members), and is defined as:

[source,java]
----
public interface Dto { }
----

The `Dto_downloadXml` mixin defines the following action:

[source,java]
----
@Mixin
public class Dto_downloadXml {
    public Dto_downloadXml(final Dto dto) { ... }     // <1>
    public Object downloadXml(final String fileName) { ... }   // <2>
    ...
}
----
<1> provided as an action to any class that (trivially) implements the `Dto` interface
<2> actually this method is called '$$' in the code, a "special case" that means to use the derive the action name
from the class name.

This will return the XML text wrapped up in a xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_value-types_Clob[`Clob`].

The `Dto_downloadXsd` mixin is similar:

[source,java]
----
@Mixin
public class Dto_downloadXsd {
    public Dto_downloadXsd(final Dto dto) { ... }                                             // <1>
    public Object downloadXsd(final String fileName, final IsisSchemes isisSchemas) { ... }   // <2>
}
----
<1> provided as an action to any class that (trivially) implements the `Dto` interface
<2> actually this is '$$' in the code, a "special case" that means to use the derive the action name from the class name.

If the domain object's JAXB annotations reference only a single XSD schema then this will return that XML text as
a xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_value-types_Clob[`Clob`] of that XSD.  If there are multiple XSD schemas referenced
then the action will return a zip of those schemas, wrapped up in a
xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_value-types_Blob[`Blob`].  The `IsisSchemas` parameter to the action can be used to
optionally ignore the common xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_schema[Apache Isis schemas] (useful if there is only one other XSD schema
referenced by the DTO).

The `Dto_downloadXml` and `Dto_downloadXsd` delegate to the
xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_JaxbService[`JaxbService`] to actually generate the XML/XSD.
