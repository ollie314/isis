The framework provides a single mixin that contributes to simply `java.lang.Object`.  It provides the ability to download the layout XML for any domain object (in practical terms: entities and view models).



[[_rgcms_classes_mixins_Object_clearHints]]
== `clearHints()`

When a domain object is rendered the end-user can select different tabs, and for collections can sort the columns,
navigate to second pages, or select different views of collections.  If the user revisits that object, the
xref:ugvw.adoc[Wicket viewer] will remember these hints and render the domain object in the same state.  These
rendering hints are also included if the user copies the URL using the anchor link (to right hand of the object's
title).

The `Object_clearHints` mixin provides the ability for the end-user to discard these hints so that the object is
rendered in its initial state:

[source,java]
----
public void clearHints() {
    ...
}
----


=== Appearance in the UI

This mixin actions are all associated with the "Metadata" fieldset.  If there is no such field set, then the action
 will be rendered as a top-level action).




=== Related Services

This mixin uses the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_HintStore[`HintStore`] service to store and retrieve UI hints for
each rendered object, per user.



[[_rgcms_classes_mixins_Object_downloadLayoutXml]]
== `downloadLayoutXml()`

The `Object_downloadLayoutXml` mixin provides an action to download the xref:ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_object-layout_dynamic_xml[layout XML] for the current domain object.  It has the following signature:

[source,java]
----
public Object downloadLayoutXml(
    @ParameterLayout(named = "File name")
    final String fileName,
    final LayoutService.Style style) {          // <1>
    ...
}
----
<1> either current, complete, normalized or minimal.

See the documentation on xref:ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_object-layout_dynamic_xml[layout XML] and also
the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_LayoutService[`LayoutService`] for more information on these styles


=== Appearance in the UI

This mixin actions are all associated with the "Metadata" fieldset.

A number of other xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_mixins_Persistable[mixins] also contribute properties and actions to the "Metadata" fieldset.



=== Related Services

This mixin calls xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_LayoutService[`LayoutService`] to obtain the layout XML.




[[_rgcms_classes_mixins_Object_rebuildMetamodel]]
== `rebuildMetamodel()`

The `Object_rebuildMetamodel` mixin provides the ability to discard the current internal metamodel data (an instance
of `ObjectSpecification`) for the domain class of the rendered object, and recreate from code and other sources (most
notably, layout XML data).  It has the following signature:

[source,java]
----
public void rebuildMetamodel() {
    ...
}
----


=== Appearance in the UI

This mixin actions are all associated with the "Metadata" fieldset.

A number of other xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_mixins_Persistable[mixins] also contribute properties and actions to
the "Metadata" fieldset.



=== Related Services

This mixin calls xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_MetaModelService[`MetaModelService`] and the
xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_GridService[`GridService`] to invalidate their caches.
