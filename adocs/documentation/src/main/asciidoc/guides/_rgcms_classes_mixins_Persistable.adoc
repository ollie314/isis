All domain entities automatically implement the DataNucleus `Persistable` role interface as a result of the enhancer
process (the fully qualified class name is `org.datanucleus.enhancement.Persistable`).  So as a developer you do not
need to write any code to obtain the mixins that contribute to this interface.

[[_rgcms_classes_mixins_Persistable_downloadJdoMetadata]]
== `downloadJdoMetadata()`

The `Persistable_downloadJdoMetadata` mixin provides an action which allows the
JDO link:http://www.datanucleus.org/products/datanucleus/jdo/metadata_xml.html[class metadata] to be downloaded as XML.  It has the following signature:

[source,java]
----
public Clob downloadJdoMetadata(                    // <1>
    @ParameterLayout(named = ".jdo file name")
    final String fileName) {
    ...
}
----
<1> returns the XML text wrapped up in a xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_value-types_Clob[`Clob`].


=== Appearance in the UI

This mixin action is associated with the "Metadata" fieldset, and will appear as a panel drop-down action.

These mixin properties are all associated with the "Metadata" fieldset.  The xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_mixins_Object[Object mixin] also contribute an action to the "Metadata" fieldset.

=== Related Services

The mixin delegates to the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_IsisJdoSupport[`IsisJdoSupport`] service to obtain
a reference to the JDO `PersistenceManagerFactory`.


[[_rgcms_classes_mixins_Persistable_datanucleusXxx]]
== `datanucleusXxx`

The framework provides a number of mixins that expose the datanucleus Id and version of a persistable domain entity.  Several implementations are provided to support different datatypes:

* `Persistable_datanucleusIdLong` will expose the entity's id, assuming that the id is or can be cast to `java.lang.Long`.  Otherwise the property will be hidden.

* `Persistable_datanucleusVersionTimestamp` will expose the entity's version, assuming that the version is or can be cast to `java.sql.Timestamp`.  Otherwise the property will be hidden.

* `Persistable_datanucleusVersionLong` will expose the entity's version, assuming that the version is or can be cast to `java.lang.Long`.  Otherwise the property will be hidden.

=== Appearance in the UI

These mixin properties are all associated with the "Metadata" fieldset.  The xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_mixins_Object[Object mixin] also contribute an action to the "Metadata" fieldset.
