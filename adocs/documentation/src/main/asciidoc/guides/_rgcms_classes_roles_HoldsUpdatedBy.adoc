The `HoldsUpdatedBy` role interface ...

[source,java]
----
public interface HoldsUpdatedBy {
    void setUpdatedBy(String updatedBy);
}
----

Entities that implement this interface often also implement xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_roles_HoldsUpdatedAt[`HoldsUpdatedAt`] role interface; as a convenience the xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_roles_Timestampable[`Timestampable`] interface combines the two roles.
