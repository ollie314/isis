The `Timestampable` role interface is a convenience that combines the xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_roles_HoldsUpdatedAt[`HoldsUpdatedAt`] and xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_roles_HoldsUpdatedBy[`HoldsUpdatedBy`] interfaces.  It is defined as:

[source,java]
----
public interface Timestampable
    extends HoldsUpdatedAt, HoldsUpdatedBy {
}
----

The interface no additional methods of its own.



== Alternatives

An alternative way to maintain a timestamp is to use JDO's `@Version` annotation.  With this approach, it is the JDO/DataNucleus that maintains the version, rather than the framework's `TimestampService`.  See xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_roles_HoldsUpdatedBy[`HoldsUpdatedBy`] for further details.
