This class extends xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_super_AbstractContainedObject[`AbstractContainedObject`].  Its
intent was to be a convenience subclass for services acting as either a repository or a factory, however note that
 all of the methods that it defines are now deprecated.

Instead, indicate that a service is repository using the xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainService_repositoryFor[`@DomainService#repositoryFor()`] attribute.
