This is a convenience superclass for creating subscriber domain services on the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_EventBusService[`EventBusService`].  It uses xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-PostConstruct[`@PostConstruct`] and
xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-PreDestroy[`@PreDestroy`] callbacks to automatically register/unregister itself
with the `EventBusService`.

It's important that subscribers register before any domain services that might emit events on the
xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_EventBusService[`EventBusService`].  For example, the (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-security[Isis addons' security] module provides a domain service that automatically
seeds certain domain entities; these will generate xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_lifecycleevent[lifecycle events] and so
any subscribers must be registered before such seed services.  The easiest way to do this is to use the
xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainServiceLayout_menuOrder[`@DomainServiceLayout#menuOrder()`] attribute.

As a convenience, the `AbstractSubscriber` specifies this attribute.
