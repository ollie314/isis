The `FixtureScript` class is an abstract class defining an API to set up data within the object store, either for integration tests or while demoing/prototyping.

The primary method that subclasses must implement is:

[source,java]
----
protected abstract void execute(final ExecutionContext executionContext);
----

In this method the fixture script can in theory do anything, but in practice it is recommended that it uses injected
domain services to set up data.  The provided `ExecutionContext` is used to invoke child fixture scripts, and alsocan be used to store references to any created objects (so that the calling test can access these objects/so that they are rendered in the view model).

See the see the xref:ugtst.adoc#_ugtst_fixture-scripts[user guide's testing chapter] for further discussion on the use of fixture scripts, in particular xref:ugtst.adoc#_ugtst_fixture-scripts_api-and-usage[fixture scripts' API and usage].
