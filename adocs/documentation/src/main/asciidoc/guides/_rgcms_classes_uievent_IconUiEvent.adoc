This event class represents a request to obtain the icon (or rather, name of icon) of a domain object.  The class has a number of responsibilities:

* capture the target object being interacted with

* capture the icon (name), if any, as specified to one of the subscribers

The class itself is instantiated automatically by the framework whenever interacting with a rendered object's action.


[NOTE]
====
If the domain object defines its own xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_methods_reserved_iconName[`iconName()`] supporting method,
or if it has the
xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainObjectLayout#cssClassFa[`@DomainObjectLayout#cssClassFa()`] attribute, then
these will take precedence.
