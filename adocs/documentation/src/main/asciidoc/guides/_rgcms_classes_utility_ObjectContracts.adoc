The `ObjectContracts` test provides a series of methods to make it easy for your domain objects to:

* implement `Comparable` (eg so can be stored in ``java.util.SortedSet``s)
* implement `toString()`
* implement `equals()`
* implement `hashCode()`

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem implements Comparable<ToDoItem> {

    public boolean isComplete() { ... }
    public LocalDate getDueBy() { ... }
    public String getDescription() { ... }
    public String getOwnedBy() { ... }

    public int compareTo(final ToDoItem other) {
        return ObjectContracts.compare(this, other, "complete","dueBy","description");
    }

    public String toString() {
        return ObjectContracts.toString(this, "description","complete","dueBy","ownedBy");
    }
}
----

[WARNING]
====
Note that `ObjectContracts` makes heavy use of Java Reflection.  While it's great to get going quickly in prototyping, we recommend you use your IDE to code generate implementations of these methods for production code.

Moreover (and perhaps even more importantly) `ObjectContracts` implementation can cause DataNucleus to recursively rehydrate a larger number of associated entities (More detail below).

We therefore recommend that you disable persistence-by-reachability by adding:

[source,ini]
.persistor_datanucleus.properties
----
isis.persistor.datanucleus.impl.datanucleus.persistenceByReachabilityAtCommit=false

== The issue in more detail

Consider the link:http://yuml.me/edit/742ad446[entities]:

In the course of a transaction, the `Agreement` entity is loaded into memory (not necessarily modified), and then new ``AgreementRole``s are associated to it.

All these entities implement `Comparable` using `ObjectContracts`, so that the implementation of ``AgreementRole``'s (simplified) is:

[source,java]
----
public class AgreementRole {
    ...
    public int compareTo(AgreementRole other) {
        return ObjectContracts.compareTo(this, other, "agreement","startDate","party");
    }
    ...
}
----

while ``Agreement``'s is implemented as:

[source,java]
----
    public class Agreement {
        ...
        public int compareTo(Agreement other) {
            return ObjectContracts.compareTo(this, other, "reference");
        }
        ...
    }
----

and ``Party``'s is similarly implemented as:

[source,java]
----
public class Party {
    ...
    public int compareTo(Party other) {
        return ObjectContracts.compareTo(this, other, "reference");
    }
    ...
}
----

DataNucleus's persistence-by-reachability algorithm adds the ``AgreementRole``s into a `SortedSet`, which causes `AgreementRole#compareTo()` to fire:

* the evaluation of the "agreement" property delegates back to the `Agreement`, whose own `Agreement#compareTo()` uses the scalar `reference` property.  As the `Agreement` is already in-memory, this does not trigger any further database queries

* the evaluation of the "startDate" property is just a scalar property of the `AgreementRole`, so will already in-memory

* the evaluation of the "party" property delegates back to the `Party`, whose own `Party#compareTo()` requires the uses the scalar `reference` property.  However, since the `Party` is not yet in-memory, using the `reference` property triggers a database query to "rehydrate" the `Party` instance.

In other words, figuring out whether `AgreementRole` is comparable requires the persistence-by-reachability algorithm to run, causing the adjacent associated entity `Party` to also be retrieved.
