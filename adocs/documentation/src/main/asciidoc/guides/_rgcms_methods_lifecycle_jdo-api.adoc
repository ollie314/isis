As an alternative to relying on Apache Isis to call lifecycle callback methods, you could instead use the JDO link:http://www.datanucleus.org/products/datanucleus/jdo/lifecycle_callbacks.html[lifecycle listener] API directly.

[NOTE]
====
We may decide to deprecate the Apache Isis callbacks in the future because they merely duplicate this functionality already available in JDO.
====

You can gain access to the relevant JDO API using the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_IsisJdoSupport[`IsisJdoSupport`] domain service.

For example:

[source,java]
----
@RequestScoped                                                   // <1>
@DomainService(nature=NatureOfService.DOMAIN)
public class ObjectChangedListenerService
        implements javax.jdo.listener.StoreLifecycleListener {   // <2>
    @Programmatic
    @PostConstruct
    public void init() {
        getPmFactory().addInstanceLifecycleListener(this);
    }
    @Programmatic
    @PreDestroy
    public void tidyUp() {
        getPmFactory().removeInstanceLifecycleListener(this);
    }
    private PersistenceManager getPersistenceManager() {
        return jdoSupport.getPersistenceManager();               // <3>
    }
    @Programmatic
    public void preStore (InstanceLifecycleEvent event) { ... }
    @Programmatic
    public void postStore (InstanceLifecycleEvent event) { ... }
    @Inject
    IsisJdoSupport jdoSupport;
}
----
<1> must be `@RequestScoped` because we register on the `PersistenceManager`, which is different for each request.
<2> implement whichever callback lifecycle listeners are of interest
<3> use the injected xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_IsisJdoSupport[`IsisJdoSupport`] service to obtain the `PersistenceManager`.

Note that it isn't possible to register on the `PersistenceManagerFactory` because listeners cannot be attached once a persistence session has been created (which it will have been when the service's `@PostConstruct` method is called).
