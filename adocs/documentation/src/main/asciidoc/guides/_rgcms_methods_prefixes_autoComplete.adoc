The `autoComplete...()` supporting method is called for action parameters and for properties to find objects from a drop-down list box.  The use case is when the number of candidate objects is expected to be large, so the user is required to enter some characters to narrow the search down.

[TIP]
====
If the number of candidate objects is comparatively small, then use xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_methods_prefixes_choices[`choices...()`] supporting method instead.
====

The signature of the supporting method depends on whether it is for a parameter or a property.


== Parameters

For an action parameter in (0-based) position _N_, and of type `T`, the signature is:

[source,java]
----
public List<T> autoCompleteNXxx(String search) { ... }
----

It is also valid to return `T[]`, a `Set<T>` or a `Collection<T>`.


For example:

[source,java]
----
public class ShoppingCartItem {
    @Property(editing=Editing.DISABLED)
    public Product getProduct() { ... }
    public void setProduct(Product product) { ... }

    @Property(editing=Editing.DISABLED)
    public int getQuantity() { ... }
    public void setQuantity(int quantity) { ... }

    @Action(semantics=SemanticsOf.IDEMPOTENT)
    public ShoppingCartItem updateProduct(
        Product product,
        @ParameterLayout(named="Quantity")
        final int quantity) {
        setProduct(product);
        setQuantity(quantity);
    }
    public Collection<Product> autoComplete0UpdateProduct(  // <1>
        @MinLength(3) String search                         // <2>
    ) {
        ...
    }
    ...
}
----
<1> `product` is the 0th argument of the action.
<2> the xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-MinLength[`@MinLength`] annotation specifies the minimum number of characters that must be entered before a search is performed for matching objects





== Properties

For a property of type `T`, the signature is:

[source,java]
----
public List<T> autoCompleteXxx(String search) { ... }
----

(As for action parameters) it is also valid to return `T[]`, a `Set<T>` or a `Collection<T>`.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class ShoppingCartItem {
    public Product getProduct() { ... }
    public void setProduct(Product product) { ... }

    public Collection<Product> autoCompleteProduct(
        @MinLength(3) String search                     // <1>
    ) {
        ...
    }
    ...
}
----
<1> the xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-MinLength[`@MinLength`] annotation specifies the minimum number of characters that must be entered before a search is performed for matching objects
