The `clear...()` supporting method is called -- instead of the setter -- whenever an (optional) property is to be set to `null`.  Its purpose is to allow additional business logic to be performed.


For example:

[source,java]
----
public class LibraryMember {
    public Title getFavoriteTitle() { ... }
    public void setFavoriteTitle(Title title) { ... }
    public void modifyFavoriteTitle(Title title) { ... }
    public void clearFavoriteTitle() {
        if(getTitle() == null) { return; }
        setFavoriteTitle(null);                         // <1>
        titleFavoritesService.decrement(title);         // <2>
    }
    ...
}
----
<1> update the property
<2> perform some additional business logic
