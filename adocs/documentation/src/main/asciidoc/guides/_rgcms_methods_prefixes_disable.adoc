The `disable...()` supporting method is called for properties, collections and actions.  It allows the modification of the property/collection to be vetoed (ie made read-only) and to prevent the invocation of the action ("grey it out").

[NOTE]
====
Directly mutable collections are not currently supported by the xref:ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer]; they are always implicitly disabled.
====

Typically modification/invocation is vetoed based on the state of the domain object being interacted with, though it could be any reason at all (eg the current date/time of the interaction, or the state of some other related data such as stock levels, or the identity of the calling user).


The reason for vetoing a modification/invocation is normally returned as a string.  However, Apache Isis' xref:ugbtb.adoc#_ugbtb_i18n[i18n support] extends this so that reasons can be internationalized.



== Actions

For an action the signature of the supporting method is:

[source,java]
----
public String disableXxx(...) { ... }
----

where the returned string is the reason the action invocation is vetoed (or `null` if not vetoed), and the supporting method takes the same parameter types as the action itself.



For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    public boolean isBlacklisted() { ... }

    public Order placeOrder(
            final Product product,
            @ParameterLayout(named="Quantity")
            final int quantity) {
        ...
    }
    public String disablePlaceOrder(
            final Product product,
            final int quantity
            ) {
        return isBlacklisted()
                    ? "Blacklisted customers cannot place orders"
                    : null;
    }
    ...
}
----



== Properties and Collections

For both properties and collections the signature of the supporting method is:

[source,java]
----
public String disableXxx() { ... }
----

where the returned string is the reason the modification is vetoed (or `null` if not vetoed).



For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    public boolean isBlacklisted() { ... }

    public BigDecimal getCreditLimit() { ... }
    public void setCreditLimit(BigDecimal creditLimit) { ... }
    public String disableCreditLimit() {
        return isBlacklisted()
                    ? "Cannot change credit limit for blacklisted customers"
                    : null;
    }
    ...
}
----
