The `hide...()` supporting method is called for properties, collections and actions.  It allows the property/collection to be completely hidden from view.

It's comparatively rare for properties or collections to be imperatively hidden from view, but actions are sometimes hidden or shown visible (as opposed to being just xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_methods_prefixes_disable[disabled], ie greyed out).


== Actions

For an action the signature of the supporting method is either:

[source,java]
----
public bool hideXxx(...) { ... }
----

where the supporting method takes the same parameter types as the action itself, or more simply:

[source,java]
----
public bool hideXxx() { ... }
----

with no parameters at all.  Returning `true` will hide the action, returning `false` leaves it visible.


For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    public boolean isBlacklisted() { ... }

    public Order placeOrder(
            final Product product,
            @ParameterLayout(named="Quantity")
            final int quantity) {
        ...
    }
    public boolean hidePlaceOrder() {
        return isBlacklisted();
    }
    ...
}
----



== Properties and Collections

For both properties and collections the signature of the supporting method is:

[source,java]
----
public boolean hideXxx() { ... }
----

where returning `true` will hide the property/collection, returning `false` leaves it visible.



For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    public boolean isBlacklisted() { ... }

    public BigDecimal getCreditLimit() { ... }
    public void setCreditLimit(BigDecimal creditLimit) { ... }
    public boolean hideCreditLimit() {
        return isBlacklisted();
    }
    ...
}
