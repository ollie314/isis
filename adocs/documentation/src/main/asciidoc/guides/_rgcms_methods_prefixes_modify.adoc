The `modify...()` supporting method is called -- instead of the setter -- whenever a property has been set to be set to a new value.  Its purpose is to allow additional business logic to be performed.


For example:

[source,java]
----
public class LibraryMember {
    public Title getFavoriteTitle() { ... }
    public void setFavoriteTitle(Title title) { ... }
    public void modifyFavoriteTitle(Title title) {
        if(getTitle() != null) {
            titleFavoritesService.decrement(getTitle());    // <1>
        }
        setFavoriteTitle(title);                            // <2>
        titleFavoritesService.decrement(title);             // <3>
    }
    public void clearFavoriteTitle() { ... }
    ...
}
----
<1> perform some additional business logic
<2> update the property
<3> perform some additional business logic
