The `removeFrom...()` supporting method is called whenever an object is removed from a collection. Its purpose is to allow additional business logic to be performed.


[NOTE]
====
Directly mutable collections are not currently supported by the xref:ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer].  The suggested workaround is to simply define an action.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class LibraryMember {
    public SortedSet<Book> getBorrowed() { ... }
    public void setBorrowed(SortedSet<Book> borrowed) { ... }
    public void addToBorrowed(Book book) { ... }
    public void removeFromBorrowed(Book book) {
        getBorrowed().remove(book);                         // <1>
        reminderService.removeReminder(this, book);         // <2>
    }
    ...
}
----
<1> update the collection
<2> perform some additional business logic
