The `validate...()` supporting method is called for properties, actions and action parameters.  It allows the proposed new value for a property to be rejected, or the proposed argument of an action parameter to be rejected, or to reject a whole set of action arguments for an actio invocation.


The reason for vetoing a modification/invocation is normally returned as a string.  However, Apache Isis' xref:ugbtb.adoc#_ugbtb_i18n[i18n support] extends this so that reasons can be internationalized if required.



== Action Parameter

For an action parameter in (0-based) position _N_, and of type `T`, the signature is:

[source,java]
----
public String validateNXxx(T proposed) { ... }
----

where the returned string is the reason why the argument is rejected (or `null` if not vetoed).


For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    public Order placeOrder(
            final Product product,
            @ParameterLayout(named="Quantity")
            final int quantity) {
        ...
    }
    public String validate0PlaceOrder(
            final Product product) {
        return product.isDiscontinued()
                    ? "Product has been discontinued"
                    : null;
    }
    ...
}
----


== Action Parameter Set

In addition to validating a single single action argument, it is also possible to validate a complete set of action arguments.  The signature is:

[source,java]
----
public String validateXxx(...) { ... }
----

where the returned string is the reason why the argument is rejected (or `null` if not vetoed), and the supporting method takes the same parameter types as the action itself.


For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    public Order placeOrder(
            final Product product,
            @ParameterLayout(named="Quantity")
            final int quantity) {
        ...
    }
    public String validatePlaceOrder(
            final Product product,
            final int quantity) {
        return quantity > product.getOrderLimit()
                    ? "May not order more than " + product.getOrderLimit() + " items for this product"
                    : null;
    }
    ...
}
----



== Properties

For properties of type `T` the signature of the supporting method is:

[source,java]
----
public String validateXxx(T proposed) { ... }
----

where the returned string is the reason the modification is vetoed (or `null` if not vetoed).



For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    public BigDecimal getCreditLimit() { ... }
    public void setCreditLimit(BigDecimal creditLimit) { ... }
    public validateCreditLimit(BigDecimal creditLimit) {
        return creditLimit.compareTo(BigDecimal.ZERO) < 0
                    ? "Credit limit cannot be negative"
                    : null;
    }
    ...
}
----
