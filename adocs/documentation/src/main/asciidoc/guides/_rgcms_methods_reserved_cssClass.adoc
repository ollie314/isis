The `cssClass()` returns a CSS class for a particular object instance.

The xref:ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] wraps the object's representation in a containing `<div>` with the class added.  This is done both for rendering the object either in a table or when rendering the object on its own page.

In conjunction with xref:rgcfg.adoc#_rgcfg_application-specific_application-css[`application.css`], can therefore provide custom styling of an object instance wherever it is rendered. +


For example, the (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-app-todoapp[Isis addons' todoapp] uses this technique to add a strikethrough for completed todo items.  This is shown on the home page:

image::{_imagesdir}reference-methods/reserved/cssClass/strikethrough.png[width="800px",link="{_imagesdir}reference-methods/reserved/cssClass/strikethrough.png"]


The code to accomplish this is straightforward:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem ... {
    public String cssClass() {
        return !isComplete() ? "todo" : "done";
    }
    ...
}
----

In the xref:rgcfg.adoc#_rgcfg_application-specific_application-css[application.css], the following styles were then added:

[source,css]
----
tr.todo {
}
tr.done {
    text-decoration: line-through;
    color: #d3d3d3;
}
----
