The `getId()` method applies only to domain services, and allows a unique identifer to be provided for that service.

This identifier corresponds in many ways to the xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainObject_objectType[`objectType()`] attribute for domain objects; it is used as an internal identifier but also appears in URLs within the xref:ugvro.adoc#[RestfulObjects viewer]'s REST API.

If the identifier is omitted, the services fully qualified class name is used.

[TIP]
====
Unlike domain objects, where the use of an object type is strongly encouraged (eg using xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-PersistenceCapable[`@PersistenceCapable`]), it matters much less if an id is specified for domain services.  The principle benefit is shorter URLs in the REST API.
