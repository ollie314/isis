The `validate()` method is used to specify that invariants pertaining to an object's state are enforced.


[WARNING]
====
(As of 1.8.0) there are known limitations with this functionality.  Invariants are enforced when an object is initially created and when it is edited, however invariants are currently _not_ enforced if an action is invoked.
====


The signature of the method is:

[source,java]
----
public String validate() { ... }
----

where the returned string is the reason that the invocation is vetoed.

Note that Apache Isis' xref:ugbtb.adoc#_ugbtb_i18n[i18n support] extends this so that the returned reason can also be internationalized.
