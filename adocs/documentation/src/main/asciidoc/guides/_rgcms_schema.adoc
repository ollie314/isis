Most applications need to integrate with other apps in the enterprise.  To facilitate such integration scenarios,
Apache Isis defines a number of standard XSD schemas:


* the xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_schema-cmd[command] schema, which captures the __intention__ of a user
to invoke an action or edit a property

* the xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_schema-ixn[interaction execution] schema, which captures the actual execution of an action invocation/property edit

* the xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_schema-chg[changes] schema, which captures which objects have been
created, updated or deleted as the result of an execution of an action invocation/property edit

* the xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_schema-aim[action memento invocation] schema (deprecated in `1.13.0`, replaced by
either "cmd" or "ixn"), which allows action invocations to be captured and reified.

These each use XSD types defined by the xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_schema-common[common schema] (most notably the `oidDto`
complex type which identifies a domain object).

The (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-command[Isis addons' command] and
http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-publishmq[Isis addons' publishmq] modules uses these schemas to reify
corresponding applib objects (`Command`, `Interaction.Execution` and `PublishedObjects`), either to persist or
publishing using an link:http://activemq.apache.org[Apache ActiveMQ] message queue.

The sections below discuss these schemas in more detail.
