The (internal) `AuditingServiceInternal` domain service acts as an internal facade to any
configured xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_AuditingService[`AuditingService`] and
xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_AuditerService[`AuditerService`] services.  It is responsible for obtaining the details
of all changes to domain objects within an interaction, and then to call the configured `AuditingService` to actually
create audit entries of those changes.

[NOTE]
====
xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_AuditingService[`AuditingService`] is now deprecated, replaced by
xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_AuditerService[`AuditerService`].

== SPI and Implementation

The SPI of the service is:

[source,java]
----
public class AuditingServiceInternal {
    public boolean canAudit();              // <1>
    public void audit();                    // <2>
}
----
<1> minor performance optimization as to whether any auditing services are actually enabled; checks to see if
any xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_AuditingService[`AuditingService`] has been configured, also if any
xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_AuditerService[`AuditService`] are enabled.
<2> uses the xref:rgfis.adoc#_rgfis_spi_ChangedObjectsServiceInternal[`ChangedObjectsServiceInternal`] to obtain details of the changed properties, then call the configured xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_AuditingService[`AuditingService`].

The service implementation is `o.a.i.c.r.s.auditing.AuditingServiceInternal`.



== Registering the Service

Assuming that the `configuration-and-annotation` services installer is configured (implicit if using the
`AppManifest` to xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_AppManifest-bootstrapping[bootstrap the app]) then Apache Isis' default
implementation of `AuditingServiceInternal` class is automatically registered (it is annotated with `@DomainService`)
so no further configuration is required.


== Related Classes

The service delegates between the (internal) xref:rgfis.adoc#_rgfis_spi_ChangedObjectsServiceInternal[`ChangedObjectsServiceInternal`] domain service  to the configured xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_AuditingService[`AuditingService`].  If no such `AuditingService` is configured, this service is in effect a no-op.

The (internal) xref:rgfis.adoc#_rgfis_spi_PublishingServiceInternal[`PublishingServiceInternal`] performs a similar function for the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_PublisherService[`PublisherService`], also collating details of the changed objects from `ChangedObjectsServiceInternal`.
