The `InteractionDtoServiceInternal` internal domain service is used by the framework to create and update DTOs representing member executions, ie the invocation of an action or the editing of a property.  The DTO is in all cases a subclass of `MemberExecutionDto`, from the xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_schema-ixn["ixn" schema], and subsequently accessible from the `Interaction` object (per the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_InteractionContext[`InteractionContext`] service).


== SPI & Implementation

The SPI of the service is:

[source,java]
----
public interface InteractionDtoServiceInternal {
    ActionInvocationDto asActionInvocationDto(          // <1>
            ObjectAction objectAction,
            ObjectAdapter targetAdapter,
            List<ObjectAdapter> argumentAdapters);
    PropertyEditDto asPropertyEditDto(                  // <2>
            OneToOneAssociation property,
            ObjectAdapter targetAdapter,
            ObjectAdapter newValueAdapterIfAny);
    ActionInvocationDto updateResult(                   // <3>
            ActionInvocationDto actionInvocationDto,
            ObjectAction objectAction,
            Object resultPojo);
}
----
<1> called by the framework when invoking an action, to create a DTO capturing the details of the action invocation (target, arguments etc).
<2> called by the framework when editing a property, to create a DTO (for the xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_schema-ixn["ixn" schema]) capturing the details of the property edit (target, new value etc).
<3> called by the framework to attach the result of an action invocation to the aforementioned DTO.

The service is implemented by `o.a.i.core.runtime.services.ixn.InteractionDtoServiceInternalDefault`.


== Related Services

The design of this service is similar to that of
xref:rgfis.adoc#_rgfis_spi_CommandDtoServiceInternal[`CommandDtoServiceInternal`], used to create the `CommandDto`
(from the xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_schema-cmd["cmd" schema]).
