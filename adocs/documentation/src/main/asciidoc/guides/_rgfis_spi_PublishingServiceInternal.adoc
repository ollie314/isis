The (internal) `PublishingServiceInternal` domain service acts as an internal facade to any
configured xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_PublisherService[`PublisherService`] or (deprecated)
xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_PublishingService[`PublishingService`] domain services.

For published action invocations/ property edits, it provides an API for those member executions to call.

For published objects, it provides an API for the framework to call at the end of the interaction; it obtains details
of the changed objects (from the
xref:rgfis.adoc#_rgfis_spi_ChangedObjectsServiceInternal[`ChangedObjectsServiceInternal`]) and filters them to just
those objects that are to be published; these are then passed through to any configured `PublisherService` or
`PublishingService` implementations.



== SPI and Implementation

The SPI of the service is:

[source,java]
----
public class PublishingServiceInternal {
    void publishAction(
            Interaction.Execution execution,        // <1>
            ObjectAction objectAction,              // <2>
            IdentifiedHolder identifiedHolder,
            ObjectAdapter targetAdapter,
            List<ObjectAdapter> parameterAdapters,
            ObjectAdapter resultAdapter);
    void publishProperty(                           // <3>
            Interaction.Execution execution);
    void publishObjects();                          // <4>
}
----
<1> to publish an action invocation, as represented by the specified member `Execution` parameter and with the
xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Action_publishing[`@Action#publishing()`] annotation attribute or equivalent, to any configured
xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_PublisherService[`PublisherService`].  The `Execution` object will be an instance of
`ActionInvocation` (see xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_InteractionContext[`InteractionContext`] for details).
<2> the remaining parameters are to support the publishing of the action to any configured
xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_PublishingService[`PublishingService`] services (deprecated).
<3> to publish a property edit, as as represented by the specified member `Execution` parameter and with the
xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Property_publishing[`@Property#publishing()`] annotation attribute or equivalent, to any
configured xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_PublisherService[`PublisherService`].  The `Execution` object will be an instance
of `PropertyEdit` (see xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_InteractionContext[`InteractionContext`] for details).
<4> to publish all changed objects that are to be published (with the
xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainObject_publishing[`@DomainObject#publishing()`] annotation attribute or equivalent).


The service implementation is `o.a.i.c.m.s.publishing.PublishingServiceInternal`.



== Registering the Service

Assuming that the `configuration-and-annotation` services installer is configured (implicit if using the
`AppManifest` to xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_AppManifest-bootstrapping[bootstrap the app]) then Apache Isis' default
implementation of `PublishingServiceInternal` class is automatically registered (it is annotated with `@DomainService`)
so no further configuration is required.


== Related Classes

The service delegates between the (internal)
xref:rgfis.adoc#_rgfis_spi_ChangedObjectsServiceInternal[`ChangedObjectsServiceInternal`] domain service to the
configured xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_PublisherService[`PublisherService`] and
 xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_PublishingService[`PublishingService`].

The (internal) xref:rgfis.adoc#_rgfis_spi_AuditingServiceInternal[`AuditingServiceInternal`] performs a similar
function for the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_PublisherService[`PublisherService`], also collating details of the
changed objects from `ChangedObjectsServiceInternal`.
