The `RepresentationService` is the main plug-in point for the xref:ugvro.adoc#[RestfulObjects viewer] to generate representations.

The default implementation generates representations according to the link:http://restfulobjects.org[Restful Objects spec] v1.0.  However, it also delegates to the xref:rgfis.adoc#_rgfis_spi_ContentNegotiationService[`ContentNegotiationService`] which provides a mechanism for altering representations according to the HTTP `Accept` header.

The principal motivation is to allow more flexible representations to be generated for REST clients that (perhaps through their use of a certain Javascript library, say) expect, or at least works best with, a certain style of representation.

In all there are three domain services that can influence the representations generated: this service, xref:rgfis.adoc#_rgfis_spi_ContentNegotiationService[`ContentNegotiationService`]and the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_ContentMappingService[`ContentMappingService`].  The diagram below shows how these collaborate:

image::{_imagesdir}reference-services-spi/RepresentationService/service-collaborations.png[width="700px",link="{_imagesdir}reference-services-spi/RepresentationService/service-collaborations.png"]

The `RepresentationServiceForRestfulObjects` is the default implementation of this service; likewise `ContentNegotiationServiceXRoDomainType` is the default implementation of the `ContentNegotiationService`.  If you inspect the source code you'll see that the default implementation of this service's primary responsibility is to generate the default Restful Objects representations.  Therefore, if you what you want to do is to generate a _different _representation then in many cases replacing either this service _or_ the `ContentNegotiationService` will be equivalent (you'll notice that their SPIs are very similar).


== SPI

The SPI defined by this service is:

[source,java]
----
public interface RepresentationService {
    Response objectRepresentation(                  // <1>
            Context rendererContext,
            ObjectAdapter objectAdapter);
    Response propertyDetails(                       // <2>
            Context rendererContext,
            ObjectAndProperty objectAndProperty,
            MemberReprMode memberReprMode);
    Response collectionDetails(                     // <3>
            Context rendererContext,
            ObjectAndCollection objectAndCollection,
            MemberReprMode memberReprMode);
    Response actionPrompt(                          // <4>
            Context rendererContext,
            ObjectAndAction objectAndAction);
    Response actionResult(                          // <5>
            Context rendererContext,
            ObjectAndActionInvocation objectAndActionInvocation,
            ActionResultReprRenderer.SelfLink selfLink);
    public static interface Context extends RendererContext {
        ObjectAdapterLinkTo getAdapterLinkTo();
    }
}
----
<1> representation of a single object, as per section 14.4 of the RO spec, v1.0
<2> representation of a single property of an object, as per section 16.4 of the RO spec v1.0
<3> representation of a single collection of an object, as per section 17.5 of the RO spec v1.0
<4> representation of a single action (prompt) of an object, as per section 18.2 of the RO spec v1.0
<5> representation of the results of a single action invocation, as per section 19.5 of the RO spec v1.0

These methods provide:

* a `RendererContext` which provides access to request-specific context (eg HTTP headers), session-specific context (eg authentication) and global context (eg configuration settings)

* an object representing the information to be rendered +
+
eg `ObjectAdapter`, `ObjectAndProperty`, `ObjectAndCollection` etc

* for members, whether the representation is in read/write mode +
+
ie `MemberReprMode`






== Implementation

As discussed in the introduction, the framework provides a default implementation, `o.a.i.v.ro.rendering.service.RepresentationServiceContentNegotiator`.   This delegates to xref:rgfis.adoc#_rgfis_spi_ContentNegotiationService[`ContentNegotiationService`] to generate an alternative representation; but if none is provided then it falls back on generating the representations as defined in the link:http://restfulobjects.org[Restful Objects spec] v1.0.

To use an alternative implementation, use
xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainServiceLayout_menuOrder[`@DomainServiceLayout#menuOrder()`] (as explained
in the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_intro_overriding-the-services[introduction] to this guide).


== Registering the Services

Assuming that the `configuration-and-annotation` services installer is configured (implicit if using the
`AppManifest` to xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_AppManifest-bootstrapping[bootstrap the app]) then Apache Isis' default implementation of `RepresentationService` service is automatically registered and injected (it is annotated with `@DomainService`) so no further configuration is required.




== Related Services

The default implementation delegates to xref:rgfis.adoc#_rgfis_spi_ContentNegotiationService[`ContentNegotiationService`], whose default implementation may delegate in turn to xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_ContentMappingService[`ContentMappingService`] (if present).
