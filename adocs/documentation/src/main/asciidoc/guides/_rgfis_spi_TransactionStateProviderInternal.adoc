The (internal) `TransactionStateProviderInternal` domain service simply provides the ability to check as to the
state of the current transaction.

[NOTE]
====
The service will probably be combined with xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_TransactionService[`TransactionService`]
in the future.

== SPI and Implementation

The SPI of the service is simply:

[source,java]
----
public interface TransactionStateProviderInternal {
    TransactionState getTransactionState();
}
----


== Runtime vs Noop implementation

The framework provides two implementations:

* `TransactionStateProviderInternalDefault` is provided by `isis-core-runtime`, and is used during normal use and integration tests

* `TransactionStateProviderInternalNoop` is provided as a fallback by `isis-core-metamodel`, and is provided to allow the xref:rgmvn.adoc[maven plugin] to be bootstrapped without any "backend" database.

The `...Default` implementation takes priority over the `...Noop` implementation.
