The Apache Isis Maven plugin defines three goals:

* `validate` +
+
Use to verify at build time that the metamodel of an application is valid.  This runs the `MetaModelValidator` that is also run when the application is started up.

* `swagger` +
+
Uses the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_SwaggerService[`SwaggerService`] to generate link:http://swagger.io[Swagger] spec files that describe the public and/or private RESTful APIs exposed by the xref:ugvro.adoc#[RestfulObjects viewer].

* `xsd` +
+
Uses the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_JaxbService[`JaxbService`] to generate XSD schemas from any JAXB-annotated view models/DTOs. +
+
This is instead of and preferable to using the JAXB link:https://jaxb.java.net/2.2.4/docs/schemagen.html[schemagen] tool, because it uses the framework's support (via xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-XmlJavaTypeAdapter[`@XmlJavaTypeAdapter`]) to translate any references to domain objects into ``OidDto``s (as defined by the Apache Isis xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_schema-common[common schema]).

The `validate` goal is by default bound to the `test` phase, and the `swagger` goal is by default bound to the `package` phase; both are typically of your application's `dom` sub-module.  The `xsd` goal meanwhile defaults to the `generate-resources` phase, and this is generally used in a completely separate sub-module.  An example can be found in the (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-app-todoapp[Isis addons' todoapp] example app; the separate submodule that uses the `xsd` goal is (also) called `todoapp-xsd`.

All of these goals require an xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_AppManifest-bootstrapping[`AppManifest`] to point the plugin at, so that
it knows how to bootstrap an Isis runtime.  This is discussed below, followed by sections on configuring the two goals.



[[_rgmvn_intro_app-manifest]]
== `AppManifest`

As noted in the introduction, all the goals require an xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_AppManifest-bootstrapping[`AppManifest`]
to point the plugin at, so that it knows how to bootstrap an Isis runtime.

This can be extremely minimal; it isn't necessary to use the main `AppManifest` (in the `app` module) used to
bootstrap the application, you can instead use a cut-down one.  This then allows the plugins to be run during the
build of the `dom` module, rather than having to run in the context of the `integtest` module.

For example, the xref:ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_getting-started_simpleapp-archetype[SimpleApp]'s
manifest is:

[source,java]
----
package domainapp.dom;
...
public class DomainAppDomManifest implements AppManifest {
    @Override
    public List<Class<?>> getModules() {
        return Arrays.asList(
                DomainAppDomainModule.class  // domain (entities and repositories)
        );
    }
    @Override
    public List<Class<?>> getAdditionalServices() { return Collections.emptyList(); }
    @Override
    public String getAuthenticationMechanism() { return null; }
    @Override
    public String getAuthorizationMechanism() { return null; }
    @Override
    public List<Class<? extends FixtureScript>> getFixtures() { return null; }
    @Override
    public Map<String, String> getConfigurationProperties() { return null; }
}
----

where `DomainAppDomainModule` simply identifies the package for the manifest to search under:

[source,java]
----
package domainapp.dom;
public final class DomainAppDomainModule { }
----


The downside of using a minimal `AppManifest` in the ``dom`` module is that any contributed actions/associations will
be ignored.

We recommend the following:

* run the `validate` goal in the `dom` submodule; this will give early warning if there are any syntactic errors in the
  model, eg orphaned supporting methods

* run the `swagger` goal in the `integtest` submodule; this ensures that the generated Swagger spec files correctly
  include any contributed actions/associations.

* run the `xsd` plugin in a new `xsd` submodule; contributed actions are irrelevant for this particular goal; having a
separate submodule allows the configuration of both the `xsd` goal (to generate the XSD schemas) and any other XSD-related configuration to be kept in a single place.

The xref:ug.adoc#_ug_getting-started_simpleapp-archetype[SimpleApp archetype] reflects these recommendations for
the `validate` and `swagger` goals.  You can find an example of the `xsd` plugin in the (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-app-todoapp[Isis addons' todoapp] application.
