The `ActionInvocationContext` domain service is a xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-RequestScoped[`@RequestScoped`] service intended to support the implementation of "bulk" actions annotated with xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Action_invokeOn[`@Action#invokeOn()`].  This allows the user to select multiple objects in a table and then invoke the same action against all of them.

When an action is invoked in this way, this service allows each object instance to "know where it is" in the collection; it acts a little like an iterator.  In particular, an object can determine if it is the last object to be called, and so can perform special processing, eg to return a summary calculated result.


== API & Implementation

The API defined by the service is:

[source,java]
----
@DomainService(nature = NatureOfService.DOMAIN)
@RequestScoped                                        // <1>
public static class ActionInvocationContext {
    public InvokedOn getInvokedOn() { ... }           // <2>
    public List<Object> getDomainObjects() { ... }    // <3>
    public int getSize() { ... }
    public int getIndex() { ... }                     // <4>
    public boolean isFirst() { ... }
    public boolean isLast() { ... }
}
----
<1> is xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-RequestScoped[`@RequestScoped`], so this domain service instance is scoped to a particular request and is then destroyed
<2> an enum set to either `OBJECT` (if action has been invoked on a single object) or `COLLECTION` (if has been invoked on a collection).
<3> returns the list of domain objects which are being acted upon
<4> is the 0-based index to the object being acted upon.



== Usage

For actions that are void or that return null, Apache Isis will return to the list once executed. But for bulk actions that are non-void, Apache Isis will render the returned object/value from the last object invoked (and simply discards the object/value of all actions except the last).

One idiom is for the domain objects to also use the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_Scratchpad[`Scratchpad`] service to share information, for example to aggregate values. The `ActionInvocationContext#isLast()` method can then be used to determine if all the information has been gathered, and then do something with it (eg derive variance across a range of values, render a graph etc).

More prosaically, the `ActionInvocationContext` can be used to ensure that the action behaves appropriately depending on how it has been invoked (on a single object and/or a collection) whether it is called in bulk mode or regular mode. Here's a snippet of code from the bulk action in the Isis addon example https://github.com/isisaddons/isis-app-todoapp/[todoapp] (not ASF):

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem ... {
    @Action(invokeOn=InvokeOn.OBJECTS_AND_COLLECTIONS)
    public ToDoItem completed() {
        setComplete(true);
        ...
        return actionInvocationContext.getInvokedOn() == InvokedOn.OBJECT
                ? this  // <1>
                : null; // <2>
    }
    @Inject
    ActionInvocationContext actionInvocationContext;
}
----
<1> if invoked as a regular action, return this object;
<2> otherwise (if invoked on collection of objects), return null, so that the xref:ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] will re-render the list of objects




== Registering the Service

Assuming that the `configuration-and-annotation` services installer is configured (implicit if using the
`AppManifest` to xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_AppManifest-bootstrapping[bootstrap the app]) then Apache Isis' default
implementation of `ActionInvocationContext` class is automatically registered (it is annotated with `@DomainService`)
so no further configuration is required.

To use an alternative implementation, use
xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainServiceLayout_menuOrder[`@DomainServiceLayout#menuOrder()`] (as explained
in the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_intro_overriding-the-services[introduction] to this guide).



== Unit testing support

The `ActionInvocationContext` class also has a couple of static factory methods intended to support unit testing:

[source,java]
----
@DomainService(nature = NatureOfService.DOMAIN)
@RequestScoped
public class ActionInvocationContext {
    public static ActionInvocationContext onObject(final Object domainObject) {
        return new ActionInvocationContext(InvokedOn.OBJECT, Collections.singletonList(domainObject));
    }
    public static ActionInvocationContext onCollection(final Object... domainObjects) {
        return onCollection(Arrays.asList(domainObjects));
    }
    public static ActionInvocationContext onCollection(final List<Object> domainObjects) {
        return new ActionInvocationContext(InvokedOn.COLLECTION, domainObjects);
    }
    ...
}
