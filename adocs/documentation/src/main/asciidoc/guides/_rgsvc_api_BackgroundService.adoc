The `BackgroundService2` domain service, and also the companion
xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_BackgroundCommandService[`BackgroundCommandService2`] SPI service, enable commands
to be persisted such that they may be invoked in the background.

The `BackgroundService2` is responsible for capturing a memento representing the command in a typesafe way,
and persisting it rather than executing it directly.

The default `BackgroundServiceDefault` implementation works by using a proxy wrapper around the target so that it can
capture the action to invoke and its arguments.  (As of `1.13.0`), this is done using xref:rgfis.adoc#_rgfis_spi_CommandDtoServiceInternal[`CommandDtoServiceInternal`] (in previous releases it used (a private copy of) xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_MementoService[`MementoService`]).

The persistence delegates the persistence of the memento to an appropriate implementation of the companion
`BackgroundCommandService2`.  One such implementation of `BackgroundCommandService` is provided by (non-ASF)
http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-command[Isis addons' command] module.

The persisting of commands is only half the story; there needs to be a separate process to read the commands and
execute them. The `BackgroundCommandExecution` abstract class (discussed
xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_BackgroundService_BackgroundCommandExecution[below]) provides infrastructure to do this;
the concrete implementation of this class depends on the configured `BackgroundCommandService` (in order to query for
the persisted (background) ``Command``s.



== API & Implementation

The API is:

[source,java]
----
public interface BackgroundService2 {
    <T> T execute(final T object);                              // <1>
    <T> T executeMixin(Class<T> mixinClass, Object mixedIn);    // <2>
}
----
<1> returns a proxy around the domain object; any methods executed against this proxy will result in a command (to invoke the corresponding action) being persisted by xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_BackgroundCommandService2[`BackgroundCommandService2`]
<2> Returns a proxy around the mixin; any methods executed against this proxy will result in a command (to invoke the corresponding mixin action) being persisted by xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_BackgroundCommandService2[`BackgroundCommandService2`].

The default implementation is provided by core (`o.a.i.core.runtime.services.background.BackgroundServiceDefault`).



== Usage

Using the service is very straight-forward; wrap the target domain object using `BackgroundService#execute(...)` and invoke the method on the object returned by that method.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public void submitCustomerInvoices() {
    for(Customer customer: customerRepository.findCustomersToInvoice()) {
        backgroundService.execute(customer).submitInvoice();
    }
    messageService.informUser("Calculating...");
}
----

This will create a bunch of background commands executing the `submitInvoice()` action for each of the customers returned from the customer repository.

The action method invoked must be part of the Apache Isis metamodel, which is to say it must be public, accept only scalar arguments, and must not be annotated with xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Programmatic[`@Programmatic`] or `@Ignore`. However, it may be annotated with xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Action_hidden[`@Action#hidden()`] or xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-ActionLayout_hidden[`@ActionLayout#hidden()`] and it will still be invoked.

In fact, when invoked by the background service, no business rules (hidden, disabled, validation) are enforced; the action method must take responsibility for performing appropriate validation and error checking.

[TIP]
====
If you want to check business rules, you can use xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-WrapperFactory[`@WrapperFactory#wrapNoExecute(...)`].

== End-user experience

For the end-user, executing an action that delegates work off to the `BackgroundService` raises the problem of how does the user know the work is complete?

One option is for the background jobs to take responsibility to notify the user themselves. In the above example, this would be the `submitInvoice()` method called upon each customer. One could imagine more complex designs where only the final command executed notifies the user.

However, an alternative is to rely on the fact that the `BackgroundService` will automatically hint that the `Command` representing the original interaction (to `submitCustomerInvoices()` in the example above) should be persisted. This will be available if the related xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_CommandContext[`CommandContext`] and xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_CommandService[`CommandService`] domain services are configured, and the `CommandService` supports persistent commands.  Note that (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-command[Isis addons' command] module does indeed provide such an implementation of `CommandService` (as well as of the required `BackgroundCommandService`).

Thus, the original action can run a query to obtain it corresponding `Command`, and return this to the user. The upshot is that the child ``Command``s created by the `BackgroundService` will then be associated with `Command` for the original action.

We could if we wanted write the above example as follows:

[source,java]
----
public Command submitCustomerInvoices() {
    for(Customer customer: customerRepository.findCustomersToInvoice()) {
        backgroundService.execute(customer).submitInvoice();
    }
    return commandContext.getCommand();
}
@Inject
CommandContext commandContext;  // <1>
----
<1> the injected xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_CommandContext[`CommandContext`] domain service.

The user would be returned a domain object representing their action invocation.




== Registering the Services

Assuming that the `configuration-and-annotation` services installer is configured (implicit if using the
`AppManifest` to xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_AppManifest-bootstrapping[bootstrap the app]) then Apache Isis' core
implementation of `BackgroundService` is automatically registered (it is annotated with `@DomainService`) so no
further configuration is required.

To use an alternative implementation, use
xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainServiceLayout_menuOrder[`@DomainServiceLayout#menuOrder()`] (as explained
in the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_intro_overriding-the-services[introduction] to this guide).



== Related Services

This service is closely related to the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_CommandContext[`CommandContext`] and also that service's supporting xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_CommandService[`CommandService`] service.

The `CommandContext` service is responsible for providing a parent `Command` with which the background ``Command``s can then be associated as children, while the `CommandService` is responsible for persisting those parent `Command`s. The latter is analogous to the way in which the `BackgroundCommandService` persists the child background `Command`s.

The implementations of `CommandService` and `BackgroundCommandService` go together; typically both parent `Command`s and child background `Command`s will be persisted in the same way. The (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-command[Isis addons' command] module provides implementations of both (see xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_CommandService[`CommandService`] and xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_BackgroundCommandService[`BackgroundCommandService`]).

The xref:rgfis.adoc#_rgfis_spi_CommandDtoServiceInternal[`CommandDtoServiceInternal`] is used to obtain
a memento of the command such that it can be persisted.  (In earlier versions, xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_MementoService[`MementoService`] was used for this purpose).
