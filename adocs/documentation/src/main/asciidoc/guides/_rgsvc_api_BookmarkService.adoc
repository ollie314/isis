The `BookmarkService2` API provides the ability to obtain a serializable ``o.a.i.applib.bookmarks.Bookmark`` for any (persisted) domain object, and to lookup domain objects given a ``Bookmark``.  This can then in turn be converted to and from a string.

For example, a `Customer` object with:

* an object type of "custmgmt.Customer" (as per xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainObject_objectType[`DomainObject#objectType()`] or equivalent) , and
* an id=123

could correspond to a `Bookmark` with a string representation of `custmgmt.Customer|123`.

[NOTE]
====
A `Bookmark` is little more than an API equivalent of Apache Isis' internal `Oid` (object identifier).  Nevertheless, the ability to uniquely address _any_ domain object within an Apache Isis system -- to in effect provide a URN -- is immensely useful.

For example, a `Bookmark` could be converted into a barcode, and then this used for automated scanning of correspondence from a customer.
====

``Bookmark``s are used by several other domain services as a means of storing areference to an arbitrary object
(a polymorphic relationship).  For example, the (non-ASF)
http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-auditing[Isis addons' auditing] module's implementation of
xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_AuditerService[`AuditerService`] uses bookmarks to capture the object
that is being audited.

[TIP]
====
One downside of using ``Bookmark``s is that there is no way for the JDO/DataNucleus objectstore to enforce any kind of referental integrity.  However, the (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-poly[Isis addons' poly] module describes and supports a design pattern to address this requirement.

== API & Implementation

The API defined by `BookmarkService2` is:

[source,java]
----
public interface BookmarkService2 {
    enum FieldResetPolicy {                                                     // <1>
        RESET,
        DONT_RESET
    }
    Object lookup(BookmarkHolder bookmarkHolder, FieldResetPolicy policy);
    Object lookup(Bookmark bookmark, FieldResetPolicy policy);
    <T> T lookup(Bookmark bookmark, FieldResetPolicy policy, Class<T> cls);     // <2>
    Bookmark bookmarkFor(Object domainObject);
    Bookmark bookmarkFor(Class<?> cls, String identifier);
}
----
<1> if the object has already been loaded from the database, then whether to reset its fields.  The default it to `RESET`.
<2> same as `lookup(Bookmark bookmark)`, but downcasts to the specified type.


The core framework provides a default implementation of this API, namely `o.a.i.core.metamodel.services.bookmarks.BookmarkServiceInternalDefault`


== `BookmarkHolder`

The `BookmarkHolder` interface is intended to be implemented by domain objects that use a `Bookmark` to reference a (single) domain object; an example might be a class such as the audit entry, mentioned above.  The interface is simply:


[source,java]
----
public interface BookmarkHolder {
    @Programmatic
    Bookmark bookmark();
}

----

There are two services that will contribute to this interface:

* `BookmarkHolderActionContributions` will provide a `lookup(...)` action
* `BookmarkHolderAssociationContributions` provides an `object` property.

Either of these can be suppressed, if required, using a vetoing subscriber.  For example, to suppress the `object` property (so that only the `lookup(...)` action is ever shown for implementations of `BookmarkHolder`, define:

[source,java]
----
@DomainService(nature=NatureOfService.DOMAIN)
public class AlwaysHideBookmarkHolderAssociationsObjectProperty {
    @Subscribe
    public void on(BookmarkHolderAssociationContributions.ObjectDomainEvent ev) {
        ev.hide();
    }
}
----

A more sophisticated implementation could look inside the passed `ev` argument and selectively hide or not based on the contributee.




== Usage by other services

Bookmarks are used by the (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-command[Isis addons' command] module's
implementation of  xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_BackgroundCommandService[`BackgroundCommandService`], which uses a
bookmark to capture the target object on which an action will be invoked subsequently.

Bookmarks are also used by the (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-publishing[Isis addons' publishing]
module's implementation of xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_PublishingService[`PublishingService`], and by the
(non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-auditing[Isis addons' auditing] module's implementation of
xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_AuditerService[`AuditerService`].




== Registering the Service

Assuming that the `configuration-and-annotation` services installer is configured (implicit if using the
`AppManifest` to xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_AppManifest-bootstrapping[bootstrap the app]) then Apache Isis' core
implementation of `BookmarkService` is automatically registered (it is annotated with `@DomainService`) so no further
configuration is required.

To use an alternative implementation, use
xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainServiceLayout_menuOrder[`@DomainServiceLayout#menuOrder()`] (as explained
in the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_intro_overriding-the-services[introduction] to this guide).
