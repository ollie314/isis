The `EventBusService` allows domain objects to emit events to subscribing domain services using an in-memory event bus.

The primary user of the service is the framework itself, which automatically emit events for xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Action_domainEvent[actions], xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Property_domainEvent[properties] and xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Collection_domainEvent[collections].  Multiple events are generated:

* when an object member is to be viewed, an event is fired; subscribers can veto (meaning that the member is hidden)
* when an object member is to be enabled, the same event instance is fired; subscribers can veto (meaning that the member is disabled, ie cannot be edited/invoked)
* when an object member is being validated, then a new event instance is fired; subscribers can veto (meaning that the candidate values/action arguments are rejected)
* when an object member is about to be changed, then the same event instance is fired; subscribers can perform pre-execution operations
* when an object member has been changed, then the same event instance is fired; subscribers can perform post-execution operations

If a subscriber throws an exception in the first three steps, then the interaction is vetoed. If a subscriber throws an exception in the last two steps, then the transaction is aborted.  For more on this topic, see xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Action_domainEvent[`@Action#domainEvent()`], xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Property_domainEvent[`@Property#domainEvent()`] and xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Collection_domainEvent[`@Collection#domainEvent()`].

It is also possible for domain objects to programmatically generate domain events.  However the events are published, the primary use case is to decoupling interactions from one module/package/namespace and another.

Two implementations are available, using either link:https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/[Guava]'s https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/wiki/EventBusExplained[`EventBus`], or alternatively using the link:http://www.axonframework.org/[AxonFramework]'s link:http://www.axonframework.org/docs/2.4/single.html#d5e1489[SimpleEventBus].  It is also possible to plug in a custom implementation.



[[_rgsvc_api_EventBusService_api-and-implementation]]
== API & Implementation

The API defined by `EventBusService` is:

[source,java]
----
public abstract class EventBusService {
    @Programmatic
    public void post(Object event) { ... }                          // <1>
    @Programmatic
    public void register(final Object domainService) { ... }        // <2>
    @Programmatic
    public void unregister(final Object domainService) { ... }      // <3>
}
----
<1> posts the event onto event bus
<2> allows domain services to register themselves.  This should be done in their xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-PostConstruct[`@PostConstruct`] initialization method (for both singleton and xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-RequestScoped[`@RequestScoped`] domain services.
<3> exists for symmetry, but need never be called (it is in fact deliberately a no-op).

Isis provides a default implementation of the service, `o.a.i.objectstore.jdo.datanucleus.service.eventbus.EventBusServiceJdo`.





== Registering Subscribers

The `register()` method should be called in the xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-PostConstruct[`@PostConstruct`] lifecycle method.  It is valid and probably the least confusing to readers to also "unregister" in the xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-PreDestroy[`@PreDestroy`] lifecycle method (though as noted xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_EventBusService_api-and-implementation[above], unregistering is actually a no-op).

For example:

[source,java]
----
@DomainService(nature=NatureOfService.DOMAIN)   // <1>
@DomainServiceLayout( menuOrder="1")            // <2>
public class MySubscribingDomainService {
    @PostConstruct
    public void postConstruct() {
        eventBusService.register(this);         // <3>
    }
    @PreDestroy
    public void preDestroy() {
        eventBusService.unregister(this);       // <4>
    }
    ...
    @javax.inject.Inject
    EventBusService eventBusService;
}
----
<1> subscribers are typically not visible in the UI, so specify a `DOMAIN` nature
<2> It's important that subscribers register before any domain services that might emit events on the event bus service.
For example, the (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-security[Isis addons' security] module provides a
domain service that automatically seeds certain domain entities; these will generate
xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_lifecycleevent[lifecycle events] and so any subscribers must be registered before such seed
services.  The easiest way to do this is to use the xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainServiceLayout_menuOrder[`@DomainServiceLayout#menuOrder()`] attribute.
<3> register with the event bus service during xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-PostConstruct[`@PostConstruct`]
    initialization
<4> corresponding deregister when shutting down

This works for both singleton (application-scoped) and also xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-RequestScoped[`@RequestScoped`] domain services.


[TIP]
====
The xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_super_AbstractSubscriber[`AbstractSubscriber`] class automatically performs this
registration.  As a convenience, it is also annotated with the
xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainServiceLayout_menuOrder[`@DomainServiceLayout#menuOrder()`] attribute.
====



== Annotating Members

As discussed in the introduction, the framework will automatically emit domain events for all of the object members (actions, properties or collections) of an object whenever that object is rendered or (more generally) interacted with.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    @Action
    public Customer placeOrder(Product product, @ParameterLayout(named="Quantity") int qty) { ... }
    ...
}
----

will propagate an instance of the default `o.a.i.applib.services.eventbus.ActionDomainEvent.Default` class.   If using the Guava event bus this can be subscribed to using:

[source,java]
----
@DomainService(nature=NatureOfService.DOMAIN)
public class MySubscribingDomainService
    @Programmatic
    @com.google.common.eventbus.Subscribe
    public void on(ActionDomainEvent ev) { ... }
    ...
}
----

or if using Axonframework, the subscriber uses a different annotation:

[source,java]
----
@DomainService(nature=NatureOfService.DOMAIN)
public class MySubscribingDomainService
    @Programmatic
    @org.axonframework.eventhandling.annotation.EventHandle
    public void on(ActionDomainEvent ev) { ... }
    ...
}
----

More commonly though you will probably want to emit domain events of a specific subtype.  As a slightly more interesting example, suppose in a library domain that a `LibraryMember` wants to leave the library. A letter should be sent out detailing any books that they still have out on loan:

In the `LibraryMember` class, we publish the event by way of an annotation:

[source,java]
----
public class LibraryMember {
    @Action(domainEvent=LibraryMemberLeaveEvent.class)  // <1>
    public void leave() { ... }
    ...
}
----
<1> `LibraryMemberLeaveEvent` is a subclass of `o.a.i.applib.eventbus.ActionDomainEvent`.  The topic of subclassing is discussed in more detail xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_EventBusService_event-hierarchy[below].

Meanwhile, in the `BookRepository` domain service, we subscribe to the event and act upon it.  For example:

[source,java]
----
public class BookRepository {
    @Programmatic
    @com.google.common.eventbus.Subscribe
    public void onLibraryMemberLeaving(LibraryMemberLeaveEvent e) {
        LibraryMember lm = e.getLibraryMember();
        List<Book> lentBooks = findBooksOnLoanFor(lm);
        if(!lentBooks.isEmpty()) {
            sendLetter(lm, lentBooks);
        }
    }
    ...
}
----

This design allows the `libraryMember` module to be decoupled from the `book` module.



[[_rgsvc_api_EventBusService_event-hierarchy]]
== Event hierarchy

By creating domain event subtypes we can be more semantically precise and in turn providesmore flexibility for subscribers: they can choose whether to be broadly applicable (by subscribing to a superclass) or to be tightly focussed (by subscribing to a subclass).

We recommend that you define event classes at (up to) four scopes:

* at the top "global" scope is the Apache Isis-defined `o.a.i.applib.event.ActionDomainEvent`
* for the "module" scope, create a static class to represent the module itself, and creating nested classes within
* for each "class" scope, create a nested static event class in the domain object's class for all of the domain object's actions
* for each "action" scope, create a nested static event class for that action, inheriting from the "domain object" class.

To put all that into code; at the module level we can define:

[source,java]
----
package com.mycompany.modules.libmem;
...
public static class LibMemModule {
    private LibMemModule() {}
    public abstract static class ActionDomainEvent<S>
                extends org.apache.isis.applib.event.ActionDomainEvent<S> {}
    ...                                                                             // <1>
    public abstract static class PropertyDomainEvent<S,T>
                extends org.apache.isis.applib.event.PropertyDomainEvent<S,T> {}
    public abstract static class CollectionDomainEvent<S,E>
                extends org.apache.isis.applib.event.CollectionDomainEvent<S,E> {}
}
----
<1> similar events for properties and collections should also be defined

For the class-level we can define:

[source,java]
----
public static class LibraryMember {
    public abstract static class ActionDomainEvent
            extends LibMemModule.ActionDomainEvent<LibraryMember> { }
    ...                                                                             // <1>
}
----
<1> similar events for properties and collections should also be defined

and finally at the action level we can define:

[source,java]
----
public class LibraryMember {
    public static class LeaveEvent extends LibraryMember.ActionDomainEvent { }
    @Action(domainEvent=LeaveEvent.class)
    public void leave() { ... }
    ...
}
----

The subscriber can subscribe either to the general superclass (as before), or to any of the classes in the hierarchy.


=== Variation (for contributing services)

A slight variation on this is to not fix the generic parameter at the class level, ie:

[source,java]
----
public static class LibraryMember {
    public abstract static class ActionDomainEvent<S>
            extends LibMemModule.ActionDomainEvent<S> { }
    ...
}
----

and instead parameterize down at the action level:

[source,java]
----
public class LibraryMember {
    public static class LeaveEvent
            extends LibraryMember.ActionDomainEvent<LibraryMember> { } // <1>
    }
    @Action(domainEvent=LeaveEvent.class)
    public void leave() { ... }
    ...
}
----

This then allows for other classes - in particular domain services contributing members - to also inherit from the class-level domain events.




== Programmatic posting

To programmatically post an event, simply call `#post()`.

The `LibraryMember` example described above could for example be rewritten into:

[source,java]
----
public class LibraryMember {
    ...
    public void leave() {
        ...
        eventBusService.post(new LibraryMember.LeaveEvent(...));    // <1>
    }
    ...
}
----
<1> `LibraryMember.LeaveEvent` could be _any_ class, not just a subclass of `o.a.i.applib.event.ActionDomainEvent`.

In practice we suspect there will be few cases where the programmatic approach is required rather than the declarative approach afforded by xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Action_domainEvent[`@Action#domainEvent()`] et al.



== Using `WrapperFactory`

An alternative way to cause events to be posted is through the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_WrapperFactory[`WrapperFactory`].  This is useful when you wish to enforce a (lack-of-) trust boundary between the caller and the callee.

For example, suppose that `Customer#placeOrder(...)` emits a `PlaceOrderEvent`, which is subscribed to by a `ReserveStockSubscriber`.  This subscriber in turn calls `StockManagementService#reserveStock(...)`.  Any business rules on `#reserveStock(...)` should be enforced.

In the `ReserveStockSubscriber`, we therefore use the `WrapperFactory`:

[source,java]
----
@DomainService(nature=NatureOfService.DOMAIN)
public class ReserveStockSubscriber {
    @Programmatic
    @Subscribe
    public void on(Customer.PlaceOrderEvent ev) {
        wrapperFactory.wrap(stockManagementService)
                      .reserveStock(ev.getProduct(), ev.getQuantity());
    }
    ...
    @Inject
    StockManagementService stockManagementService;
    @Inject
    WrapperFactory wrapperFactory;
}
----


== Implementation SPI

The implementation of `EventBusService` provided by Apache Isis will by default use link:https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/[Guava]'s https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/wiki/EventBusExplained[`EventBus`] as the underlying in-memory event bus.  Alternatively the link:http://www.axonframework.org/[AxonFramework]'s link:http://www.axonframework.org/docs/2.4/single.html#d5e1489[SimpleEventBus] can be used.  Which is used is specified through configuration property (described xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_EventBusService_Configuration[below]).

[NOTE]
.Guava vs Axon, which to use?
====
Guava actually queues up events; they are not guaranteed to be dispatched immediately.  This generally is not problem, but can be for cases where the subscriber may in turn want to post its own events (using xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_WrapperFactory[`WrapperFactory`]).

The Axon `SimpleEventBus`-based implementation on the other hand is fully synchronous; events are dispatched as soon as they are posted.  This works well in all scenarios (that we have tested).
====


It is also possible to use some other implementation.

[source,java]
----
public interface EventBusImplementation {
    void register(Object domainService);
    void unregister(Object domainService);
    void post(Object event);
}
----

As is probably obvious, the `EventBusService` just delegates down to these method calls when its own similarly named methods are called.

If you do provide your own implementation of this SPI, be aware that your subscribers will need to use whatever convention is required (eg different annotations) such that the events are correctly routed through to your subscribers.



[[_rgsvc_api_EventBusService_Configuration]]
== Configuration

The implementation of `EventBusService` provided by Apache Isis will by default use link:https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/[Guava]'s https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/wiki/EventBusExplained[`EventBus`] as the underlying in-memory event bus.  Alternatively the link:http://www.axonframework.org/[AxonFramework]'s link:http://www.axonframework.org/docs/2.4/single.html#d5e1489[SimpleEventBus] can be used.

To specify which, add the xref:rgcfg.adoc#_rgcfg_configuring-core[configuration property] `isis.services.eventbus.implementation`:

[source,ini]
----
isis.services.eventbus.implementation=guava
----

or

[source,ini]
----
isis.services.eventbus.implementation=axon
----

If you have written your own implementation of the `EventBusServiceImplementation` SPI, then specify instead its fully-qualified class name:

[source,ini]
----
isis.services.eventbus.implementation=com.mycompany.isis.MyEventBusServiceImplementation
----



In addition, there is one further configuration property, whether to allow "late registration":

[source,ini]
----
isis.services.eventbus.allowLateRegistration=false
----

Late registration refers to the idea that a domain service can register itself with the `EventBusService` after events have been posted.  Since domain services are set up at boot time, this almost certainly constitutes a bug in the code and so by default late registration is _not_ allowed.  Setting the above property to `true` disables this check.





== Registering the Services

Assuming that the `configuration-and-annotation` services installer is configured (implicit if using the
`AppManifest` to xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_AppManifest-bootstrapping[bootstrap the app]) then Apache Isis' core
implementation of `EventBusService` service is automatically registered and injected (it is annotated with
`@DomainService`) so no further configuration is required.

To use an alternative implementation, use
xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainServiceLayout_menuOrder[`@DomainServiceLayout#menuOrder()`] (as explained
in the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_intro_overriding-the-services[introduction] to this guide).




== Related Services

The `EventBusService` is intended for fine-grained publish/subscribe for object-to-object interactions within an Apache Isis domain object model. The event propagation is strictly in-memory, and there are no restrictions on the object acting as the event (it need not be serializable, for example).

The xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_PublishingService[`PublishingService`] meanwhile is intended for coarse-grained publish/subscribe for system-to-system interactions, from Apache Isis to some other system. Here the only events published are those that action invocations (for actions annotated with xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Action_publishing[`@Action#publishing()`]) and of changed objects (for objects annotated with xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainObject_publishing[`@DomainObject#publishing()`]).
