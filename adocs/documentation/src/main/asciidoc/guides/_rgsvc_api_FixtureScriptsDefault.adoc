The `FixtureScriptsDefault` service provides the ability to execute xref:ugtst.adoc#_ugtst_fixture-scripts_api-and-usage[fixture scripts] .

The service extends from the xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_super_FixtureScripts[`FixtureScripts`], and is only instantiated by the framework if there no custom implementation of `FixtureScripts` has been otherwise provided; in other words it is a fallback.

If this service is instantiated (as a fallback) then it uses the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_FixtureScriptsSpecificationProvider[`FixtureScriptsSpecificationProvider`] to obtain a `FixtureScriptsSpecification`.  This configures this service, telling it which package to search for `FixtureScript` classes, how to execute those classes, and hints that influence the UI.

[TIP]
====
We recommend using xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_FixtureScriptsSpecificationProvider[`FixtureScriptsSpecificationProvider`] rather than subclassing xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_super_FixtureScripts[`FixtureScripts`].

== API & Implementation

The API for the service is:

[source,java]
----
public class FixtureScriptsDefault ... {
    @Programmatic
    public List<FixtureResult> runFixtureScript(
        FixtureScript fixtureScript,
        String parameters) { ... }
}
----

... in other words the same as xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_super_FixtureScripts[`FixtureScripts`] superclass that it inherits from.


== Configuration

As noted in the introduction, this service is only instantiated if there is no other implementation of `FixtureScripts` available on the classpath.

If an instance of `FixtureScriptsSpecificationProvider` is available on the classpath, then the service will be visible in the UI (assuming xref:rgcfg.adoc#_rgcfg_deployment-types[prototype mode]).  Otherwise the service will be available only to be injected and invoked programmatically.




== Related Services

The service interacts with xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_FixtureScriptsSpecificationProvider[`FixtureScriptsSpecificationProvider`].
