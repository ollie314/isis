The `GuiceBeanProvider` domain service acts as a bridge between Apache Isis' xref:ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] internal bootstrapping using link:https://github.com/google/guice[Google Guice].

This service operates at a very low-level, and you are unlikely to have a need for it.  It is used internally by the framework, in the default implementation of the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_DeepLinkService[`DeepLinkService`].

[NOTE]
====
Currently Apache Isis uses a combination of Guice (within the Wicket viewer only) and a home-grown dependency injection framework.  In future versions we intended to refactor the framework to use CDI throughout.  At that time this service is likely to become redundant because we will allow any of the internal components of Apache Isis to be injected into your domain object code.
====


== API & Implementation

The API defined by this service is:

[source,java]
----
public interface GuiceBeanProvider {
    @Programmatic
    <T> T lookup(Class<T> beanType);
    @Programmatic
    <T> T lookup(Class<T> beanType, final Annotation qualifier);
}
----

The xref:ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] this provides an implementation of this service.



== Usage

Using the xref:ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] requires subclassing of `IsisWicketApplication`.  In the subclass it is commonplace to override `newIsisWicketModule()`, for example:

[source,java]
----
@Override
protected Module newIsisWicketModule() {
    final Module isisDefaults = super.newIsisWicketModule();
    final Module overrides = new AbstractModule() {
        @Override
        protected void configure() {
            bind(String.class).annotatedWith(Names.named("applicationName"))
                              .toInstance("ToDo App");
            bind(String.class).annotatedWith(Names.named("applicationCss"))
                              .toInstance("css/application.css");
            bind(String.class).annotatedWith(Names.named("applicationJs"))
                              .toInstance("scripts/application.js");
            ...
        }
    };
    return Modules.override(isisDefaults).with(overrides);
}
----

This "module" is in fact a Guice module, and so the `GuiceBeanProvider` service can be used to lookup any of the components bound into it.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class SomeDomainObject {
    private String lookupApplicationName() {
        return guiceBeanProvider.lookup(String.class, Names.named("applicationName"));
    }
    @Inject
    GuiceBeanProvider guiceBeanProvider;
}
----

should return "ToDo App".



== Registering the Services

Assuming that the `configuration-and-annotation` services installer is configured (implicit if using the
`AppManifest` to xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_AppManifest-bootstrapping[bootstrap the app]), _and_ that the
xref:ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] is being used, then an implementation of `GuiceBeanProvider` is
automatically registered and injected (it is annotated with `@DomainService`) so no further configuration is required.

To use an alternative implementation, use
xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainServiceLayout_menuOrder[`@DomainServiceLayout#menuOrder()`] (as explained
in the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_intro_overriding-the-services[introduction] to this guide).
