This service simply provides access to the home page object (if any) that is returned from the domain service
action annotated with xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-HomePage[`@HomePage`].

It is originally introduced to support the default implementation of
xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_RoutingService[`RoutingService`], but was factored out to support alternative implementations
of that service (and may be useful for other use cases).


== API & Implementation

The API defined by `HomePageProviderService` is:

[source,java]
----
@DomainService(nature = NatureOfService.DOMAIN)
public interface HomePageProviderService {
    @Programmatic
    Object homePage();
}
----

The default implementation is provided by `o.a.i.core.runtime.services.homepage.HomePageProviderServiceDefault`.



== Registering the Service

Assuming that the `configuration-and-annotation` services installer is configured (implicit if using the
`AppManifest` to xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_AppManifest-bootstrapping[bootstrap the app]) then Apache Isis' core
implementation of `HomePageProviderService` is automatically registered (it is annotated with `@DomainService`) so no further
configuration is required.
