The `MementoService` was originally introduced to simplify the implementation of
xref:ugbtb.adoc#_ugbtb_view-models[ViewModel]s which are required by the framework to return string representation of
all of their backing state, moreover which is safe for use within a URL.  This usage is deprecated; use xref:ugbtb.adoc#_ugbtb_view-models_jaxb[JAXB view models] instead.

The service can also be used to create a memento of arbitrary objects, however this usage is also deprecated.  (Prior
to `1.13.0` it was used internally by the core implementation of
xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_BackgroundService[`BackgroundService`] to capture the state of action invocations so that
they can be executed by a background process; this is now done using
xref:rgfis.adoc#_rgfis_spi_CommandDtoServiceInternal[`CommandDtoServiceInternal`]).


[NOTE]
====
As of `1.13.0` this service is deprecated, replaced by internal domain services.
====




== API & Implementation

The API defined by `MementoService` is:

[source,java]
----
@Deprecated
public interface MementoService {
    @Deprecated
    public static interface Memento {
        public Memento set(String name, Object value);
        public <T> T get(String name, Class<T> cls);
        public String asString();
        public Set<String> keySet();
    }
    public Memento create();
    public Memento parse(final String str);
    public boolean canSet(Object input);
}
----

The core framework provides a default implementation of this API, namely
`o.a.i.c.r.services.memento.MementoServiceDefault`.  The string returned (from `Memento#asString()`) is a base-64 URL
encoded representation of the underlying format (an XML string).

[NOTE]
====
In fact, the `MementoServiceDefault` implementation does provide a mechanism to disable the URL encoding, but this is
not part of the `MementoService` public API. Note also that the encoding method is not pluggable.
====

The types of objects that are supported by the `MementoService` are implementation-specific, but would typically
include all the usual value types as well as Apache Isis' `Bookmark` class (to represent references to arbitrary
entities). Nulls can also be set.

In the case of the default implementation provided by the core framework, the types supported are:

* `java.lang.String`
* `java.lang.Boolean`, `boolean`
* `java.lang.Byte`, `byte`
* `java.lang.Short`, `short`
* `java.lang.Integer`, `int`
* `java.lang.Long`, `long`
* `java.lang.Float`, `float`
* `java.lang.Double`, `double`
* `java.lang.Character`, `char`
* `java.math.BigDecimal`
* `java.math.BigInteger`
* `org.joda.time.LocalDate`
* `org.apache.isis.applib.services.bookmark.Bookmark`

If using another implementation, the `canSet(...)` method can be used to check if the candidate object's type is supported.



== Usage

As noted in the introduction, a common use case for this service is in the implementation of the xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_super_AbstractViewModel[`ViewModel`] interface.

[TIP]
====
Rather than implementing `ViewModel`, it's usually easier to annotate your view models with xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-ViewModel[`@ViewModel`] (or equivalently xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainObject_nature[`@DomainObject#nature=EXTERNAL_ENTITY`] or xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainObject_nature[`@DomainObject#nature=INMEMORY_ENTITY`].
====

For example, suppose you were implementing a view model that represents an external entity in a SOAP web service.  To access this service the view model needs to store (say) the hostname, port number and an id to the object.

Using an injected `MementoService` the view model can roundtrip to and from this string, thus implementing the `ViewModel` API:

[source,java]
----
public class ExternalEntity implements ViewModel {
    private String hostname;
    private int port;
    private String id;
    public String viewModelMemento() {                      // <1>
        return mementoService.create()
                .set("hostname", hostname)
                .set("port", port)
                .set("id", id)
                .asString();
    }
    public void viewModelInit(String mementoStr) {          // <2>
        Memento memento = mementoService.parse(mementoStr);
        hostname = memento.get("hostname", String.class);
        port = memento.get("port", int.class);
        id = memento.get("id", String.class);
    ...
    @Inject
    MementoService mementoService;
}

== Related Services

(Prior to `1.13.0`), the memento service was used by the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_CommandContext[`CommandContext`]
service and also
xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_BackgroundCommandService[`BackgroundCommandService`]. These both use a memento to capture a
representation of an action invocation.  This is now done using
xref:rgfis.adoc#_rgfis_spi_CommandDtoServiceInternal[`CommandDtoServiceInternal`].




== Registering the Service

Assuming that the `configuration-and-annotation` services installer is configured (implicit if using the
`AppManifest` to xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_AppManifest-bootstrapping[bootstrap the app]) then Apache Isis' core
implementation of `MementoService` service is automatically registered and injected (it is annotated with
`@DomainService`) so no further configuration is required.

To use an alternative implementation, use
xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainServiceLayout_menuOrder[`@DomainServiceLayout#menuOrder()`] (as explained
in the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_intro_overriding-the-services[introduction] to this guide).
