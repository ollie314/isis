The `MessageService` allows domain objects to raise information, warning or error messages.  These messages can either be simple strings, or can be translated.

[NOTE]
====
The methods in this service replace similar methods (now deprecated) in xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_DomainObjectContainer[`DomainObjectContainer`].
====


== API and Usage

The API of `MessageService` is:

[source,java]
----
public interface MessageService {

    void informUser(String message);                                                            // <1>
    String informUser(TranslatableString message, Class<?> contextClass, String contextMethod); // <2>

    void warnUser(String message);                                                              // <3>
    String warnUser(TranslatableString message, Class<?> contextClass, String contextMethod);   // <4>

    void raiseError(String message);                                                            // <5>
    String raiseError(TranslatableString message, Class<?> contextClass, String contextMethod); // <6>
    ...
}
----
<1> display as a transient message to the user (not requiring acknowledgement).  In the xref:ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] this is implemented as a toast that automatically disappears after a period of time.
<2> ditto, but with translatable string, for xref:ugbtb.adoc#_ugbtb_i18n[i18n support].
<3> warn the user about a situation with the specified message.  In the xref:ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] this is implemented as a toast that must be closed by the end-user.
<4> ditto, but with translatable string, for i18n support.
<5> show the user an unexpected application error.  In the xref:ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] this is implemented as a toast (with a different colour) that must be closed by the end-user.
<6> ditto, but with translatable string, for i18n support.



For example:

[source,java]
----
public Order addItem(Product product, @ParameterLayout(named="Quantity") int quantity) {
    if(productRepository.stockLevel(product) == 0) {
        messageService.warnUser(
            product.getDescription() + " out of stock; order fulfillment may be delayed");
    }
    ...
}
----



== Implementation

The core framework provides a default implementation of this service (`o.a.i.core.runtime.services.message.MessageServiceInternalDefault`).




== Registering the Service

Assuming that the `configuration-and-annotation` services installer is configured (implicit if using the
`AppManifest` to xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_AppManifest-bootstrapping[bootstrap the app]) then Apache Isis' core
implementation of `MessageService` service is automatically registered and injected (it is annotated with
`@DomainService`) so no further configuration is required.

To use an alternative implementation, use
xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainServiceLayout_menuOrder[`@DomainServiceLayout#menuOrder()`] (as explained
in the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_intro_overriding-the-services[introduction] to this guide).
