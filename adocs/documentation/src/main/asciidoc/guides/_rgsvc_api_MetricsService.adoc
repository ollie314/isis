The `MetricsService` is a request-scoped domain service that hooks into the JDO/DataNucleus
ObjectStore to provide a number of counters relating to numbers of object loaded, dirtied etc.

The service is used by the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_InteractionContext[`InteractionContext`] domain service (to populate the DTO held by the `Interaction.Execution`) and also by the (internal) xref:rgfis.adoc#_rgfis_spi_PublishingServiceInternal[`PublishingServiceInternal`] domain service (to populate
the `PublishedObjects` class.


== API & Implementation

The API of the service is:

[source,java]
----
@RequestScoped
public interface MetricsService {
    int numberObjectsLoaded();              // <1>
    int numberObjectsDirtied();             // <2>
    int numberObjectPropertiesModified();   // <3>
}
----
<1> The number of objects that have, so far in this request, been loaded from the database. Corresponds to the number of times that `javax.jdo.listener.LoadLifecycleListener#postLoad(InstanceLifecycleEvent)` is fired.
<2> The number of objects that have, so far in this request, been dirtied/will need updating in the database); a good measure of the footprint of the interaction.  Corresponds to the number of times that `javax.jdo.listener.DirtyLifecycleListener#preDirty(InstanceLifecycleEvent)` callback is fired.
<3> The number of individual properties of objects that were modified; a good measure of the amount of work being done in the interaction.  Corresponds to the number of times that the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_AuditingService[`AuditingService`]'s (or
xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_AuditerService[`AuditerService`]'s) `audit(...)` method will be called as the transaction
completes.

The framework provides a default implementation of this API, namely `o.a.i.c.r.s.metrics.MetricsServiceDefault`.


== Registering the Service

Assuming that the `configuration-and-annotation` services installer is configured (implicit if using the
`AppManifest` to xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_AppManifest-bootstrapping[bootstrap the app]) then Apache Isis' default
implementation of `MetricsService` class is automatically registered (it is annotated with `@DomainService`)
so no further configuration is required.


== Related Services

The xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_PublisherService[`PublisherService`] also captures the metrics gathered by the
`MetricsService` and publishes them as part of the `PublishedObjects` class (part of its SPI).
