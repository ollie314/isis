The `RepositoryService` collects together methods for creating, persisting and searching for entities from the underlying persistence store.  It acts as an abstraction over the JDO/DataNucleus objectstore.

You can use it during prototyping to write naive queries (find all rows, then filter using the Guava `Predicate` API, or you can use it to call JDO link:http://www.datanucleus.org/products/accessplatform_4_0/jdo/query.html#named[named queries] using JDOQL.

As an alternative, you could also use link:http://www.datanucleus.org/products/accessplatform_4_0/jdo/jdoql_typesafe.html[JDO typesafe queries] through the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_IsisJdoSupport[`IsisJdoSupport`] service.


[NOTE]
====
The methods in this service replace similar methods (now deprecated) in xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_DomainObjectContainer[`DomainObjectContainer`].

== API

The API of `RepositoryService` is:

[source,java]
----
public interface RepositoryService {
    <T> T instantiate(final Class<T> ofType);                                               // <1>

    boolean isPersistent(Object domainObject);                                              // <2>
    void persist(Object domainObject);                                                      // <3>
    void persistAndFlush(Object domainObject);                                              // <4>

    void remove(Object persistentDomainObject);                                             // <5>
    void removeAndFlush(Object persistentDomainObject);                                     // <6>

    <T> List<T> allInstances(Class<T> ofType, long... range);                               // <7>

    <T> List<T> allMatches(Query<T> query);                                                 // <8>
    <T> List<T> allMatches(Class<T> ofType, Predicate<? super T> predicate, long... range); // <9>

    <T> T uniqueMatch(Query<T> query);                                                      // <10>
    <T> T uniqueMatch(final Class<T> ofType, final Predicate<T> predicate);                 // <11>

    <T> T firstMatch(Query<T> query);                                                       // <12>
    <T> T firstMatch(final Class<T> ofType, final Predicate<T> predicate);                  // <13>
}
----
<1> create a new non-persisted domain entity.  This is identical to
xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_FactoryService[`FactoryService`]'s `instantiate(...)` method, but is provided in the
``RepositoryService``'s API too because instantiating and persisting objects are often done together.
<2> test whether a particular domain object is persistent or not
<3> persist (ie save) an object to the persistent object store (or do nothing if it is already persistent).
<4> persist (ie save) and flush; same as `persist()`, but also flushes changes to database and updates managed properties and collections (i.e., 1-1, 1-n, m-n relationships automatically maintained by the DataNucleus persistence mechanism).
<5> remove (ie delete) an object from the persistent object store (or do nothing if it has already been deleted).
<6> remove (delete) and flush;  same as `remove()`, but also flushes changes to database and updates managed properties and collections (i.e., 1-1, 1-n, m-n relationships automatically maintained by the DataNucleus persistence mechanism).
<7> return all persisted instances of specified type.  Mostly for prototyping, though can be useful to obtain all instances of domain entities if the number is known to be small.  The optional varargs parameters are for paging control; more on this below.
<8> all persistence instances matching the specified `Query`.  Query itself is an Isis abstraction on top of JDO/DataNucleus' Query API.  *This is the primary API used for querying*
<9> As the previous, but with client-side filtering using a `Predicate`.  Only really intended for prototyping.
<10> Returns the first instance that matches the supplied query.  If no instance is found then `null `will be returned, while if there is more that one instances a run-time exception will be thrown.  Generally this method is preferred for looking up an object by its (primary or alternate) key.
<11> As the previous, but with client-side filtering using a `Predicate`.  Only really intended for prototyping.
<12> Returns the first instance that matches the supplied query.  If no instance is found then `null `will be returned.  No exception is thrown if more than one matches, so this is less strict that `uniqueMatch(...)`.
<13> As the previous, but with client-side filtering using a `Predicate`.  Only really intended for prototyping.


The `uniqueMatch(...)` methods are the recommended way of querying for (precisely) one instance.  The `firstMatch(...)` methods are for less strict querying.


== Usage

This section briefly discusses how application code can use (some of) these APIs.


=== Persist

[source,java]
----
Customer cust = repositoryService.instantiate(Customer.class);
cust.setFirstName("Freddie");
cust.setLastName("Mercury");
repositoryService.persist(cust);
----

You should be aware that by default Apache Isis queues up calls to `#persist()` and `#remove()`.  These are then executed either when the request completes (and the transaction commits), or if the queue is flushed.  This can be done either implicitly by the framework, or as the result of a direct call to `#flush()`.

By default the framework itself will cause `#flush()` to be called whenever a query is executed by way of `#allMatches(Query)`, as documented xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_DomainObjectContainer_generic-repository-api[above].  However, this behaviour can be disabled using the  xref:rgcfg.adoc#_rgcfg_configuring-core[configuration property] `isis.services.container.disableAutoFlush`.



=== `persistAndFlush(...)`, `removeAndFlush(...)`

In some cases, such as when using managed properties and collections for implementing 1-1, 1-n, or m-n relationships,
the developer needs to invoke `flush()` to send the changes to the DataNucleus persistence mechanism.  These
managed properties and collections and then updated.

The `persistAndFlush(...)` and `removeAndFlush(...)` methods save the developer from
having to additionally call the `flush(...)` method after calling `persist()` or `remove()`.

For example, the following code requires a flush to occur, so uses these methods:

[source,java]
----
public abstract class Warehouse extends SalesVIPEntity<Marketplace> {

    @Persistent(mappedBy = "marketplace", dependentElement = "true")
    @Getter @Setter                                                             // <1>
    private SortedSet<MarketplaceExcludedProduct> excludedProducts =
                            new TreeSet<MarketplaceExcludedProduct>();

    @Action(semantics = SemanticsOf.IDEMPOTENT)
    public MarketplaceExcludedProduct addExcludedProduct(final Product product) {
        MarketplaceExcludedProduct marketplaceExcludedProduct = this.findExcludedProduct(product);
        if (marketplaceExcludedProduct == null) {
            marketplaceExcludedProduct =
                this.factoryService.instantiate(MarketplaceExcludedProduct.class);
        }

        this.wrap(marketplaceExcludedProduct).setMarketplace(this);
        this.wrap(marketplaceExcludedProduct).setProduct(product);

        this.repositoryService.persistAndFlush(marketplaceExcludedProduct);     // <2>
        return marketplaceExcludedProduct;
    }

    @Action(semantics = SemanticsOf.IDEMPOTENT)
    public void deleteFromExcludedProducts(final Product product) {
        final MarketplaceExcludedProduct marketplaceExcludedProduct = findExcludedProduct(product);
        if (marketplaceExcludedProduct != null) {
            this.repositoryService.removeAndFlush(marketplaceExcludedProduct);
        }
    }
    ...                                                                         // <3>
}
----
<1> using lombok for brevity
<2> Needed for updating the managed properties and collections.
<3> injected services and other methods ommited

On the “addExcludedProduct()” action, if the user didn’t flush, the following test would fail because the managed
collection would not containing the given product:

[source,java]
----
@Test
public void addExcludedProduct() {

    // given
    final AmazonMarketplace amazonMarketplace = this.wrapSkipRules(
        this.marketplaceRepository).findOrCreateAmazonMarketplace(
            AmazonMarketplaceLocation.FRANCE);

    final Product product = this.wrap(this.productRepository)
        .createProduct(UUID.randomUUID().toString(), UUID.randomUUID().toString());

    // when
    this.wrap(amazonMarketplace).addExcludedProduct(product);

    // then
    Assertions.assertThat(
            this.wrapSkipRules(amazonMarketplace).findAllProductsExcluded()
        ).contains(product);                                                    // <1>
}
----
<1> this would fail.



=== Query and `xxxMatches(...)`

There are various implementations of the `Query` API, but these either duplicate functionality of the other overloads of `allMatches(...)` or they are not supported by the JDO/DataNucleus object store.   The only significant implementation of `Query` to be aware of is `QueryDefault`, which identifies a named query and a set of parameter/argument tuples.

For example, in the (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-app-todoapp[Isis addons' todoapp] the `ToDoItem` is annotated:

[source,java]
----
@javax.jdo.annotations.Queries( {
    @javax.jdo.annotations.Query(
            name = "findByAtPathAndComplete", language = "JDOQL",               // <1>
            value = "SELECT "
                    + "FROM todoapp.dom.module.todoitem.ToDoItem "
                    + "WHERE atPath.indexOf(:atPath) == 0 "                     // <2>
                    + "   && complete == :complete"),                           // <3>
    ...
})
public class ToDoItem ... {
    ...
}
----
<1> name of the query
<2> defines the `atPath` parameter
<3> defines the `complete` parameter

This JDO query definitions are used in the `ToDoItemRepositoryImplUsingJdoql` service:

[source,java]
----
@DomainService(nature = NatureOfService.DOMAIN)
public class ToDoItemRepositoryImplUsingJdoql implements ToDoItemRepositoryImpl {
    @Programmatic
    public List<ToDoItem> findByAtPathAndCategory(final String atPath, final Category category) {
        return container.allMatches(
                new QueryDefault<>(ToDoItem.class,
                        "findByAtPathAndCategory",                              // <1>
                        "atPath", atPath,                                       // <2>
                        "category", category));                                 // <3>
    }
    ...
    @javax.inject.Inject
    DomainObjectContainer container;
}
----
<1> corresponds to the "findByAtPathAndCategory" JDO named query
<2> provide argument for the `atPath` parameter.  The pattern is parameter, argument, parameter, argument, ... and so on.
<3> provide argument for the `category` parameter.  The pattern is parameter, argument, parameter, argument, ... and so on.

Other JDOQL named queries (not shown) follow the exact same pattern.

With respect to the other query APIs, the varargs parameters are optional, but allow for (client-side and managed) paging.  The first parameter is the `start` (0-based, the second is the `count`.

[TIP]
====
It is also possible to query using DataNucleus' type-safe query API.  For more details, see xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_IsisJdoSupport[`IsisJdoSupport`].
====



== Implementation

The core framework provides a default implementation of this service (`o.a.i.core.metamodel.services.repository.RepositoryServiceDefault`).




=== (Disabling) Auto-flush

Normally any queries are automatically preceded by flushing pending commands to persist or remove objects.

This key allows this behaviour to be disabled.

     *
     * <p>
     *     Originally introduced as part of ISIS-1134 (fixing memory leaks in the objectstore)
     *     where it was found that the autoflush behaviour was causing a (now unrepeatable)
     *     data integrity error (see <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ISIS-1134?focusedCommentId=14500638&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-14500638">ISIS-1134 comment</a>, in the isis-module-security.
     *     However, that this could be circumvented by removing the call to flush().
     *     We don't want to break existing apps that might rely on this behaviour, on the
     *     other hand we want to fix the memory leak.  Adding this configuration property
     *     seems the most prudent way forward.
     * </p>
     */
    public static final String KEY_DISABLE_AUTOFLUSH = "isis.services.container.disableAutoFlush";



== Registering the Service

Assuming that the `configuration-and-annotation` services installer is configured (implicit if using the
`AppManifest` to xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_AppManifest-bootstrapping[bootstrap the app]) then Apache Isis' core
implementation of `RepositoryService` service is automatically registered and injected (it is annotated with
`@DomainService`) so no further configuration is required.

To use an alternative implementation, use
xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainServiceLayout_menuOrder[`@DomainServiceLayout#menuOrder()`] (as explained
in the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_intro_overriding-the-services[introduction] to this guide).



== Related Services

the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_FactoryService[`FactoryService`] is often used in conjunction with the `RepositoryService`, to instantiate domain objects before persisting.
