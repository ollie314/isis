The `SwaggerService` generates link:http://swagger.io/[Swagger] spec files to describe the public and/or private RESTful APIs exposed by the xref:ugvro.adoc#[RestfulObjects viewer].

These spec files can then be used with the link:http://swagger.io/swagger-ui/[Swagger UI] page to explore the REST API, or used to generate client-side stubs using the link:http://swagger.io/swagger-codegen/[Swagger codegen] tool, eg for use in a custom REST client app.

[NOTE]
====
Not all of the REST API exposed by the xref:ugvro.adoc#[Restful Objects viewer] is included in the Swagger spec files; the emphasis is those REST resources that are used to develop custom apps: domain objects, domain object collections and action invocations.  When combined with Apache Isis' own xref:ugvro.adoc#_ugvro_simplified-representations[simplified representations], these are pretty much all that is needed  for this use case.

== API & Implementation

The API defined by `SwaggerService` is:

[source,java]
----
public interface SwaggerService {
    enum Visibility {
        PUBLIC,                     // <1>
        PRIVATE,                    // <2>
        PRIVATE_WITH_PROTOTYPING;   // <3>
    }
    enum Format {                   // <4>
        JSON,
        YAML
    }
    String generateSwaggerSpec(final Visibility visibility, final Format format);
}
----
<1> Generate a Swagger spec for use by third-party clients, ie public use.  This specification is restricted only to
xref:ugbtb.adoc#_ugbtb_view-models[view model]s and to domain services with a xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainService_nature[nature] of `VIEW_REST_ONLY`.
<2> Generate a Swagger spec for use only by internally-managed clients, ie private internal use.  This specification includes domain entities and all menu domain services (as well as any view models).
<3> Generate a Swagger spec that is the same as private case (above), but also including any xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Action_restrictTo[prototype] actions.
<4> Swagger specs can be written either in JSON or YAML format.

Isis provides a default implementation of the service, `o.a.i.core.metamodel.services.swagger.SwaggerServiceDefault`.



== Usage within the framework

This service is provided as a convenience for applications, it is not (currently) used by the framework itself.



== Registering the Service

Assuming that the `configuration-and-annotation` services installer is configured (implicit if using the
`AppManifest` to xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_AppManifest-bootstrapping[bootstrap the app]) then Apache Isis' core
implementation of `SwaggerService` service is automatically registered and injected (it is annotated with `@DomainService`) so no further configuration is required.


== Related Services

A `SwaggerServiceMenu` domain service provides a prototype action that enables the swagger spec to be downloaded from the Wicket viewer's UI.

Apache Isis' xref:rgmvn.aod[Maven plugin] also provides a xref:rgmvn.adoc#_rgmvn_swagger[swagger goal] which allows the spec file(s) to be generated at build time.  this then allows client-side stubs can then be generated in turn as part of a build pipeline.
