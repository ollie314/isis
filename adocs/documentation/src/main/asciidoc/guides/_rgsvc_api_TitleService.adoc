The `TitleService` provides methods to programmatically obtain the title and icon of a domain object.

[NOTE]
====
The methods in this service replace similar methods (now deprecated) in xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_DomainObjectContainer[`DomainObjectContainer`].
====



== API

The API of `TitleService` is:

[source,java]
----
public interface PresentationService {
    String titleOf(Object domainObject);                // <1>
    String iconNameOf(Object domainObject);             // <2>
}
----
<1> return the title of the object, as rendered in the UI by the Apache Isis viewers.
<2> return the icon name of the object, as rendered in the UI by the Apache Isis viewers.



== Usage

By way of example, here's some code based on a system for managing government benefits:

[source,java]
----
public class QualifiedAdult {

    private Customer qualifying;

    public String title() {
        return "QA for " + titleService.titleOf(qualifying);
    }

    ...
    @Inject
    TitleService titleService;
}
----

In this example, whatever the title of a `Customer`, it is reused within the title of that customer's ``QualifiedAdult`` object.



== Implementation

The core framework provides a default implementation of this service (`o.a.i.core.metamodel.services.title.TitleServiceDefault`).



== Registering the Service

Assuming that the `configuration-and-annotation` services installer is configured (implicit if using the
`AppManifest` to xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_AppManifest-bootstrapping[bootstrap the app]) then Apache Isis' core
implementation of `TitleService` service is automatically registered and injected (it is annotated with
`@DomainService`) so no further configuration is required.

To use an alternative implementation, use
xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainServiceLayout_menuOrder[`@DomainServiceLayout#menuOrder()`] (as explained
in the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_intro_overriding-the-services[introduction] to this guide).
