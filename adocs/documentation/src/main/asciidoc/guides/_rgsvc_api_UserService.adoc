The `UserService` allows the domain object to obtain the identity of the user interacting with said object.


[NOTE]
====
The methods in this service replace similar methods (now deprecated) in xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_DomainObjectContainer[`DomainObjectContainer`].

== API and Usage

The API of `UserService` is:

[source,java]
----
public interface UserService {
    UserMemento getUser();
}
----

where in turn (the essence of) `UserMemento` is:

[source,java]
----
public final class UserMemento {
    public String getName() { ... }
    public boolean isCurrentUser(final String userName) { ... }

    public List<RoleMemento> getRoles() { ... }
    public boolean hasRole(final RoleMemento role) { ... }
    public boolean hasRole(final String roleName) { ... }
    ...
}
----

and `RoleMemento` is simpler still:

[source,java]
----
public final class RoleMemento {
    public String getName() { ... }
    public String getDescription() { ... }
    ...
}
----

The roles associated with the `UserMemento` will be based on the configured xref:ugsec.adoc#[security] (typically Shiro).

In addition, when using the xref:ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] there will be an additional "org.apache.isis.viewer.wicket.roles.USER" role; this is used internally to restrict access to web pages without authenticating.





== Implementation

The core framework provides a default implementation of this service (`o.a.i.core.runtime.services.user.UserServiceDefault`).




== Registering the Service

Assuming that the `configuration-and-annotation` services installer is configured (implicit if using the
`AppManifest` to xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_AppManifest-bootstrapping[bootstrap the app]) then Apache Isis' core
implementation of `UserService` service is automatically registered and injected (it is annotated with
`@DomainService`) so no further configuration is required.

To use an alternative implementation, use
xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainServiceLayout_menuOrder[`@DomainServiceLayout#menuOrder()`] (as explained
in the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_intro_overriding-the-services[introduction] to this guide).
