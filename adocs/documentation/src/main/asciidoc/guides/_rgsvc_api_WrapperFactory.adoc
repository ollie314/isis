The `WrapperFactory` provides the ability to enforce business rules for programmatic interactions between domain objects.  If there is a (lack-of-) trust boundary between the caller and callee -- eg if they reside in different modules -- then the wrapper factory is a useful mechanism to ensure that any business constraints defined by te callee are honoured.

For example, if the calling object attempts to modify an unmodifiable property on the target object, then an exception will be thrown.  Said another way: interactions are performed "as if" they are through the viewer.

[NOTE]
====
For a discussion of the use of the `WrapperFactory` within integration tests (the primary or at least original use case for this service) can be found xref:ugtst.adoc#_ugtst_integ-test-support_wrapper-factory[here]
====

This capability goes beyond enforcing the (imperative) constraints within the `hideXxx()`, `disableXxx()` and `validateXxx()` supporting methods; it also enforces (declarative) constraints such as those represented by annotations, eg `@MaxLength` or `@Regex`.

This capability is frequently used within xref:ugtst.adoc#_ugtst_integ-test-support[integration tests], but can also be used in production code. (There are analogies that can be drawn here with the way that JEE beans can interact through an EJB local interface).




== API

The API provided by the service is:

[source,java]
----
public interface WrapperFactory {
    @Programmatic
    <T> T wrap(T domainObject);                             // <1>
    @Programmatic
    <T> T unwrap(T possibleWrappedDomainObject);            // <2>
    @Programmatic
    <T> boolean isWrapper(T possibleWrappedDomainObject);   // <3>

    public static enum ExecutionMode {                      // <4>
        EXECUTE(true,true),
        SKIP_RULES(false, true),                            // <5>
        NO_EXECUTE(true, false);                            // <6>
    }
    @Programmatic
    <T> T wrap(T domainObject, ExecutionMode mode);         // <7>
    @Programmatic
    <T> T wrapNoExecute(T domainObject);                    // <8>
    @Programmatic
    <T> T wrapSkipRules(T domainObject);                    // <9>
    ...
 }
----
<1> wraps the underlying domain object.  If it is already wrapped, returns the object back unchanged.
<2> Obtains the underlying domain object, if wrapped.  If the object is not wrapped, returns back unchanged.
<3> whether the supplied object has been wrapped.
<4> enumerates how the wrapper interacts with the underlying domain object.
<5> validate all business rules and then execute.
<6> skip all business rules and then execute (including creating xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Action_command[command]s and firing pre- and post-execute xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Action_domainEvent[domain event]s).
<7> validate all business rules (including those from xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Action_domainEvent[domain event]s) but do not execute.
<8> convenience method to invoke `wrap(...)` with `ExecuteMode#NO_EXECUTE` (make this feature more discoverable)
<9> convenience method to invoke `wrap(...)` with `ExecuteMode#SKIP_RULES` (make this feature more discoverable)



The service works by returning a "wrapper" around a supplied domain object (a link:http://www.javassist.org[javassist] proxy), and it is this wrapper that ensures that the hide/disable/validate rules implies by the Apache Isis programming model are enforced. The wrapper can be interacted with as follows:

* a `get...()` method for properties or collections
* a `set...()` method for properties
* an `addTo...()` or `removeFrom...()` method for collections
* any action

Calling any of the above methods may result in a (subclass of) `InteractionException` if the object disallows it. For example, if a property is annotated with `@Hidden` then a `HiddenException` will be thrown. Similarly if an action has a `validateXxx()` method and the supplied arguments are invalid then an `InvalidException` will be thrown.

In addition, the following methods may also be called:

* the xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_methods_reserved_title[`title()`] and `toString()` methods
* any xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_methods_prefixes_default[`default...()`], xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_methods_prefixes_choices[`choices...()`] or xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_methods_prefixes_autoComplete[`autoComplete...()`] methods

An exception will be thrown if any other methods are thrown.





== Usage

The caller will typically obtain the target object (eg from some repository) and then use the injected `WrapperFactory` to wrap it before interacting with it.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class CustomerAgent {
    @Action
    public void refundOrder(final Order order) {
        final Order wrappedOrder = wrapperFactory.wrap(order);
        try {
            wrappedOrder.refund();
        } catch(InteractionException ex) {          // <1>
            container.raiseError(ex.getMessage());  // <2>
            return;
        }
    }
    ...
    @Inject
    WrapperFactory wrapperFactory;
    @Inject
    DomainObjectContainer container;
}
----
<1> if any constraints on the `Order`'s `refund()` action would be violated, then ...
<2> ... these will be trapped and raised to the user as a warning.

[NOTE]
====
It ought to be possible to implement an xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_ExceptionRecognizer[`ExceptionRecognizer`]s that would allow the above boilerplate to be removed.  This recognizer service would recognize the `InteractionException` and convert to a suitable message.

At the time of writing Apache Isis does not provide an out-of-the-box implementation of such an `ExceptionRecognizer`; but it should be simple enough to write oneâ€¦
====




== Listener API

The `WrapperFactory` also provides a listener API to allow other services to listen in on interactions.

[source,java]
----
public interface WrapperFactory {
    ...
    @Programmatic
    List<InteractionListener> getListeners();                               // <1>
    @Programmatic
    public boolean addInteractionListener(InteractionListener listener);    // <2>
    @Programmatic
    public boolean removeInteractionListener(InteractionListener listener); // <3>
    @Programmatic
    public void notifyListeners(InteractionEvent ev);                       // <4>
}
----
<1> all ``InteractionListener``s that have been registered.
<2> registers an `InteractionListener`, to be notified of interactions on all wrappers.  The listener will be notified of interactions even on wrappers created before the listener was installed. (From an implementation perspective this is because the wrappers delegate back to the container to fire the events).
<3> remove an `InteractionListener`, to no longer be notified of interactions on wrappers.
<4> used by the framework itself

The original intent of this API was to enable test transcripts to be captured (in a BDD-like fashion) from integration tests.  No such feature has yet been implemented however.  Also, the capabilities have by and large been superceded by Apache Isis' support for domain events.  We may therefore deprecate this API in the future.




== Registering the Service

Assuming that the `configuration-and-annotation` services installer is configured (implicit if using the
`AppManifest` to xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_AppManifest-bootstrapping[bootstrap the app]) then Apache Isis' core
implementation of `WrapperFactory` service is automatically registered and injected (it is annotated with
`@DomainService`) so no further configuration is required.

To use an alternative implementation, use
xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainServiceLayout_menuOrder[`@DomainServiceLayout#menuOrder()`] (as explained
in the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_intro_overriding-the-services[introduction] to this guide).
