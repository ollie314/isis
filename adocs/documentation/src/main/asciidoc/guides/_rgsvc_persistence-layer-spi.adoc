The persistence layer SPIs influence how the framework persists domain objects, for example controlling how to create an audit log of changes to domain objects.


The table below summarizes the persistence layer SPIs defined by Apache Isis.  It also lists their corresponding implementation, either a default implementation provided by Apache Isis itself, or provided by one of the in (non-ASF) link:http://www.isisaddons.org[Isis Addons] modules.
