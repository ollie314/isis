The `BackgroundCommandService` (SPI) service supports the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_BackgroundService[`BackgroundService`] (API) service, persisting action invocations as commands such that they can subsequently be invoked in the background.

The `BackgroundService` is responsible for capturing a memento representing the action invocation, and then hands off to the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_BackgroundCommandService[`BackgroundCommandService`] `BackgroundCommandService` to actually persist it.

The persisting of commands is only half the story; there needs to be a separate process to read the commands and execute them.  The abstract xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_BackgroundService_BackgroundCommandExecution[`BackgroundCommandExecution`] provides a mechanism to execute such commands.  This can be considered an API, albeit "internal" because the implementation relies on internals of the framework.




== SPI

The SPI of the `BackgroundCommandService` is:

[source,java]
----
public interface BackgroundCommandService {
    void schedule(
            ActionInvocationMemento aim,        // <1>
            Command parentCommand,              // <2>
            String targetClassName,
            String targetActionName,
            String targetArgs);

}
----
<1> is a wrapper around a xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_MementoService[`MementoService`]'s `Memento`, capturing the details of the action invocation to be retained (eg persisted to a database) so that it can be executed at a later time
<2> reference to the parent `Command` requesting the action be performed as a background command.  This allows information such as the initiating user to be obtained.

The API of `ActionInvocationMemento` in turn is:

[source,java]
----
public class ActionInvocationMemento {
    public String getActionId() { ... }
    public String getTargetClassName() { ... }
    public String getTargetActionName() { ... }
    public Bookmark getTarget() { ... }
    public int getNumArgs() { ... }
    public Class<?> getArgType(int num) throws ClassNotFoundException { ... }
    public <T> T getArg(int num, Class<T> type) { ... }

    public String asMementoString() { ... }     // <1>
}
----
<1> lets the `BackgroundCommandService` implementation convert the action invocation into a simple string.



== "Internal" SPI

The `BackgroundCommandExecution` (in isis-core) is an abstract template class for  xref:ugbtb.adoc#_ugbtb_headless-access_AbstractIsisSessionTemplate[headless access], that defines an abstract hook method to obtain background `Command`s to be executed:

[source,java]
----
public abstract class BackgroundCommandExecution
                         extends AbstractIsisSessionTemplate {
    ...
    protected abstract List<? extends Command> findBackgroundCommandsToExecute();
    ...
}
----

The developer is required to implement this hook method in a subclass.




== Implementation

The (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-command[Isis addons' command] module provides an implementation (`org.isisaddons.module.command.dom.BackgroundCommandServiceJdo`) that persists ``Command``s using the JDO/DataNucleus object store.  It further provides a number of supporting services:

* `org.isisaddons.module.command.dom.BackgroundCommandServiceJdoRepository` is a repository to search for persisted background ``Command``s

* `org.isisaddons.module.command.dom.BackgroundCommandServiceJdoContributions` contributes actions for searching for persisted child and sibling ``Command``s.

The module also provides a concrete subclass of `BackgroundCommandExecution` that knows how to query for persisted (background) `Command`s such that they can be executed by a scheduler.

[TIP]
====
Details of setting up the Quartz scheduler to actually execute these persisted commands can be found on the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_BackgroundService[`BackgroundService`] page.
====




== Usage

Background commands can be created either declaratively or imperatively.

The declarative approach involves annotating an action using xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Action_command[`@Action#command()`] with `@Action#commandExecuteIn=CommandExecuteIn.BACKGROUND`.

The imperative approach involves explicitly calling the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_BackgroundService[`BackgroundService`] from within domain object's action.




== Registering the Services

The (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-command[Isis addons' command] module provides an implementation
of this service (`BackgroundCommandService`), and also provides a number of related domain services
(`BackgroundCommandServiceJdo`, `BackgroundCommandJdoRepository` and `BackgroundCommandServiceJdoContributions`).  This
module also provides service implementations of the
xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_CommandService[`CommandService`].

Assuming that an `AppManifest` is being used to xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_AppManifest-bootstrapping[bootstrap the app])
then this can be activated by updating the `pom.xml` and updating the `AppManifest#getModules()` method.

If contributions are not required in the UI, these can be suppressed either using security or by implementing a
xref:ugbtb.adoc#_ugbtb_decoupling_vetoing-visibility[vetoing subscriber].





== Related Services

As discussed above, this service supports the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_BackgroundService[`BackgroundService`] , persisting `Command`s such that they can be executed in the background.

There is also a tie-up with the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_CommandContext[`CommandContext`] and its supporting xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_CommandService[`CommandService`] domain service. The `CommandContext` service is responsible for providing a parent `Command` with which the background `Command`s can then be associated as children, while the `CommandService` is responsible for persisting those parent `Command`s (analogous to the way in which the `BackgroundCommandService` persists the child background `Command`s). The `BackgroundCommandService` ensures that these background `Command`s are associated with the parent "foreground" `Command`.

What that means is that the implementations of `CommandService` and `BackgroundCommandService` go together, hence both implemented in the (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-command[Isis addons' command] module.).
