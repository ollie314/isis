The `EmailSerializer` service is a supporting service intended for use by (any implementation of) xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_PublishingService[`PublishingService`].  Its responsibility is to combine the `EventMetadata` and the `EventPayload` into some serialized form (such as JSON, XML or a string) that can then be published.

[WARNING]
====
This service is deprecated, replaced with xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_PublisherService[`PublisherService`].

See xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_PublishingService[`PublishingService`] for further discussion.




== SPI

The SPI defined by this service is:

[source,java]
----
@Deprecated
public interface EventSerializer {
    Object serialize(                   // <1>
            EventMetadata metadata,     // <2>
            EventPayload payload);      // <3>
}
----
<1> returns an object for maximum flexibility, which is then handed off to the `PublishingService`.
<2> standard metadata about the event, such as the user, the xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_mixins_HasTransactionId[`transactionId`], date/time etc
<3> for published actions, will generally be an `EventPayloadForActionInvocation` (or subclass thereof); for published objects, will generally be an `EventPayloadForObjectChanged` (or subclass thereof)

It's important to make sure that the publishing service implementation is able to handle the serialized form.  Strings are a good lowest common denominator, but in some cases a type-safe equivalent, such as a w3c DOM `Document` or JSON node might be passed instead.





== Implementation

The (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-publishing[Isis addons' publishing] module provides an implementation (`org.isisaddons.module.publishing.dom.eventserializer.RestfulObjectsSpecEventSerializer`) that represents the event payload using the representation defined by the link:http://restfulobjects.org[Restful Objects spec] of (transient) objects, grafting on the metadata as additional JSON nodes.

For example, this is the JSON generated on an action invocation:

.JSON representation of a published action invocation
image::{_imagesdir}reference-services-spi/EventSerializer/action-invocation-published-to-stderr.png[width="750px",link="{_imagesdir}reference-services-spi/EventSerializer/action-invocation-published-to-stderr.png"]

while this is the object change JSON:

.JSON representation of a published changed object
image::{_imagesdir}reference-services-spi/EventSerializer/changed-object-published-to-stderr.png[width="750px",link="{_imagesdir}reference-services-spi/EventSerializer/changed-object-published-to-stderr.png"]

You could if you wish change the representation by registering your own implementation of this API in `isis.properties`:




== Registering the Services

There is no default implementation of this service provided by the core Apache Isis framework.

The (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-publishing[Isis addons' publishing] module provides an
implementation of this service (`RestfulObjectsSpecEventSerializer`) that serializes action invocations and published
objects into a format based on the Restful Objects specification.  It also (as you might imagine) provides an
implementation of the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_PublishingService[`PublishingService`].

Assuming that an `AppManifest` is being used to xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_AppManifest-bootstrapping[bootstrap the app])
then this can be activated by updating the `pom.xml` and updating the `AppManifest#getModules()` method.



== Related Services

This service is intended (though not mandated) to be used by implementations of xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_PublishingService[`PublishingService`].  The (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-publishing[Isis addons' publishing] module does use it (though the (non-ASF)
http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-publishmq[Isis addons' publishmq] module does not).
