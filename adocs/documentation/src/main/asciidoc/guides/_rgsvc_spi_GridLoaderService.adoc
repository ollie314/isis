The `GridLoaderService` provides the ability to load the XML layout (grid) for a domain class.

== SPI

The SPI defined by this service is:

[source,java]
----
public interface GridLoaderService {
    boolean supportsReloading();                // <1>
    void remove(Class<?> domainClass);          // <2>
    boolean existsFor(Class<?> domainClass);    // <3>
    Grid load(final Class<?> domainClass);      // <4>
}
----
<1> whether dynamic reloading of layouts is enabled.  The default implementation enables reloading for prototyping, disables in production
<2> support metamodel invalidation/rebuilding of spec, eg as called by this xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_mixins_Object_rebuildMetamodel[Object mixin] action.
<3> whether any persisted layout metadata (eg a `.layout.xml` file) exists for this domain class.
<4> returns a new instance of a xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_layout_component[`Grid`] for the specified domain class, eg as loaded from a `layout.xml` file.  If none exists, will return null (and the calling xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_GridService[`GridService`] will use xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_GridSystemService[`GridSystemService`] to obtain a default grid for the domain class).



== Implementation

The framework provides a default implementation of this service, namely `GridLoaderServiceDefault`.  This implementation
loads the grid from its serialized representation as a `.layout.xml` file, loaded from the classpath.

For example, the layout for a domain class `com.mycompany.myapp.Customer` would be loaded from `com/mycompany/myapp/Customer.layout.xml`.


== Registering the Services

Assuming that the `configuration-and-annotation` services installer is configured (implicit if using the
`AppManifest` to xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_AppManifest-bootstrapping[bootstrap the app]), then the
 default implementation of `GridLoaderService` is automatically registered and injected, and no further
 configuration is required.

To use an alternative implementation, use
xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainServiceLayout_menuOrder[`@DomainServiceLayout#menuOrder()`] (as explained
in the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_intro_overriding-the-services[introduction] to this guide).


== Related Services

This service is used by xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_GridService[`GridService`].
