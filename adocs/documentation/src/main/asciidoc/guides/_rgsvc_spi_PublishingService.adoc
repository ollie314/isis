The `PublishingService` API is intended for coarse-grained publish/subscribe for system-to-system interactions, from Apache Isis to some other system.  Here the only events published are those that action invocations and of changed objects.  A typical use case is to publish onto a pub/sub bus such as link:http://activemq.apache.org/[ActiveMQ] with link:http://camel.apache.org[Camel] to keep other systems up to date.


[WARNING]
====
As of `1.13.0` this service is deprecated, replaced with xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_PublisherService[`PublisherService`].
====



== SPI

The SPI defined by the service is:

[source,java]
----
@Deprecated
public interface PublishingService {
    public void publish(
        EventMetadata metadata,                                 // <1>
        EventPayload payload);                                  // <2>
    void setEventSerializer(EventSerializer eventSerializer);   // <3>
}
----
<1> standard metadata about the event, such as the user, the xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_mixins_HasTransactionId[`transactionId`], date/time etc
<2> for published actions, an `EventPayloadForActionInvocation` (or subclass thereof); for published objects, an `EventPayloadForObjectChanged` (or subclass thereof)
<3> injects in the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_EventSerializer[`EventSerializer`] service.  This is deprecated because not every implementation is required to use an `EventSerializer` so its inclusion within the SPI of `PublishingService` was in retrospect a mistake.


Typically implementations will use the injected `EventSerializer` to convert the metadata and payload into a form to be published:

[source,java]
----
public interface EventSerializer {
    public Object serialize(EventMetadata metadata, EventPayload payload);
}
----

The serialized form returned by `EventSerializer` must be in a form that the `PublishingService` implementation is able to handle. Strings are a good lowest common denominator, but (if custom implementations of both `EventSerializer` and `PublishingService` were in use) then it might also be some other type, for example an `org.w3c.dom.Document` or an `org.json.JSONObject` might be returned instead.



== Implementation

The (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-publishing[Isis addons' publishing] module provides an
implementation (`org.isisaddons.module.publishing.dom.PublishingService`) that persists each
event as a `PublishedEvent` entity.  This holds the serialized form of the event metadata and payload as translated
into a string by the injected `EventSerializer`.  The module also provides its own implementation of `EventSerializer`,
namely `RestfulObjectsSpecEventSerializer`, which represents the event payload using the representation defined by the
link:http://restfulobjects.org[Restful Objects spec] of (transient) objects, grafting on the metadata as additional
JSON nodes.

The `PublishedEvent` entity also has a `state` field taking the values either "QUEUED" or "PROCESSED".  The intention
here is that an event bus can poll this table to grab pending events and dispatch them to downstream systems.  When
``PublishedEvent``s are persisted initially they always take the value "QUEUED".

The framework provides no default implementations of this service.



== Usage

To indicate that an action invocation should be published, annotate it with the xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Action_publishing[`@Action#publishing()`] annotation.

To indicate that a changed object should be published is to annotate it with the xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainObject_publishing[`@DomainObject#publishing()`] annotation.


It is also possible to "fine-tune" the `EventPayload` using the `#publishingFactory()` attribute (for both annotations).  By default the `EventPayload` that is serialized identifies the object(s) being interacted with or changed, and in the case of the action invocation provides details of the action arguments and result (if any) of that action.  However, the payload does not (by default) include any information about the new state of these objects. It is therefore the responsibility of the subscriber to call back to Apache Isis to determine any information that has not been published.

[NOTE]
====
The replacement xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_PublisherService[`PublisherService`] does __not__ support the concept of "payload factories" (but is otherwise more flexible).
====


Although the representations (if using the Restful Object serializer and Restful Objects viewer) does include hrefs
for the objects, this nevertheless requires an additional network call to obtain this information).

In some circumstances, then, it may make more sense to eagerly "push" information about the change to the subscriber by including that state within the payload.

To accomplish this, an implementation of a "`PayloadFactory`" must be specified in the annotation.

For actions, we implement the `PublishingPayloadFactoryForAction` (in `o.a.i.applib.annotation`):

[source,java]
----
@Deprecated
public interface PublishingPayloadFactoryForAction {
    public EventPayload payloadFor(
            Identifier actionIdentifier,
            Object target,
            List<Object> arguments,
            Object result);
}
}
----
The `EventPayloadForActionInvocation` abstract class (in the Isis applib) should be used as the base class for the object instance returned from `payLoadFor(...)`.

For objects, the interface to implement is `PublishingPayloadFactoryForObject`:

[source,java]
----
@Deprecated
public interface PublishingPayloadFactoryForObject {
    public EventPayload payloadFor(
        Object changedObject,
        PublishingChangeKind publishingChangeKind);     // <1>
}
----
<1> an enum taking the values `CREATE`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`

Similarly, the `EventPayloadForObjectChanged` abstract class should be used as the base class for the object returned from `payLoadFor(...)`.

For example, the following will eagerly include a `ToDoItem`'s `description` property whenever it is changed:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObject(publishingPayloadFactory=ToDoItemPayloadFactory.class)
public class ToDoItem {
    ...
}
----

where `ToDoItemPayloadFactory` is defined as:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItemChangedPayloadFactory implements PublishingPayloadFactoryForObject {
    public static class ToDoItemPayload
        extends EventPayloadForObjectChanged<ToDoItem> {
      public ToDoItemPayload(ToDoItem changed) { super(changed); }
      public String getDescription() { return getChanged().getDescription(); }
    }
    @Override
    public EventPayload payloadFor(Object changedObject, PublishingChangeKind kind) {
        return new ToDoItemPayload((ToDoItem) changedObject);
    }
}
----




== Registering the Services

There is no default implementation of this service provided by the core Apache Isis framework.

The (non-ASF) Isis addons' http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-publishing[publishing] module provides an
implementation of this service. Assuming that an `AppManifest` is being used to
xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_AppManifest-bootstrapping[bootstrap the app]) then this can be activated by updating
the `pom.xml` and updating the `AppManifest#getModules()` method.

The module also provides services that contribute to the UI.  If contributions are not required in the UI, these can be
suppressed either using security or by implementing a
xref:ugbtb.adoc#_ugbtb_decoupling_vetoing-visibility[vetoing subscriber].





== Related Services

The `PublishingService` is intended for coarse-grained publish/subscribe for system-to-system interactions, from
Apache Isis to some other system. Here the only events published are those that action invocations (for actions
annotated with xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Action_publishing[`@Action#publishing()`]) and of changed objects (for objects
annotated with xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainObject_publishing[`@DomainObject#publishing()`].

The xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_PublisherService[`PublisherService`] is intended as a replacement for this service.  The
use case for `PublisherService` is the same: coarse-grained publishing of events for system-to-system interactions.  It
is in most respects more flexible though: events are published both for action invocations (annotated with
xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Action_publishing[`@Action#publishing()`]) and also for property edits (annotated with
xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Property_publishing[`@Property#publishing()`].  It also publishes changed objects (for objects
annotated with xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainObject_publishing[`@DomainObject#publishing()`]).  However, rather than
publishing one event for every changed objects, it publishes a single event that identifies all objects created,
updated or deleted.

Another significant difference between `PublishingService` and `PublisherService` is in the content of the events
themselves.  While the former uses the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_MementoService[`MementoService`] to create an
ad-hoc serialization of the action being invoked, the latter uses the xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_schema[DTOs/XML schemas]
as a formal specification of the nature of the interaction (action invocation, property edit or changed objects).

The xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_EventBusService[`EventBusService`] meanwhile differs from both `PublishingService` and
xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_PublisherService[`PublisherService`] in that it is intended for fine-grained
publish/subscribe for object-to-object interactions within an Apache Isis domain object model. The event propagation
is strictly in-memory, and there are no restrictions on the object acting as the event; it need not be serializable,
for example.  (That said, it is possible to obtain a serialization of the action invocation/property edit causing the
current event to be raised using xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_InteractionContext[`InteractionContext`] domain service).
