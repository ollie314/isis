The `TranslationService` is the cornerstone of Apache Isis' i18n support.  Its role is to be able to provide translated versions of the various elements within the Apache Isis metamodel (service and object classes, properties, collections, actions, action parameters) and also to translate business rule (disable/valid) messages, and exceptions.  These translations provide for both singular and plural forms.

== SPI

The SPI defined by this service is:

[source,java]
----
public interface TranslationService {
    @Programmatic
    String translate(String context, String text);      // <1>
    @Programmatic
    String translate(String context,                    // <2>
                     String singularText,
                     String pluralText, int num);

    enum Mode { READ, WRITE;}
    @Programmatic
    Mode getMode();                                     // <3>
}

----
<1> translate the text, in the locale of the "current user".
<2> return a translation of either the singular or the plural text, dependent on the `num` parameter, in the locale of the "current user"
<3> whether this implementation is operating in read or in write mode.

If in read mode, then the translations are expected to be present.

If in write mode, then the implementation is saving translation keys, and will always return the untranslated translation.




== Implementation

The Apache Isis framework provides a default implementation (`TranslationServicePo`) that uses the GNU `.pot` and `.po` files for translations.  It relies on the `LocaleProvider` service (to return the `Locale` of the current user) and also the `TranslationsResolver` service (to read existing translations).

The framework also provides a supporting `TranslationServicePoMenu` provides menu items under the "Prototyping" secondary menu for controlling this service and downloading `.pot` files for translation.

For more details on the implementation, see xref:ugbtb.adoc#_ugbtb_i18n[i18n support].




== Registering the Services

Assuming that the `configuration-and-annotation` services installer is configured (implicit if using the
`AppManifest` to xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_AppManifest-bootstrapping[bootstrap the app]) then Apache Isis' core
implementation of `TranslationService` service (along with the supporting menu service) are automatically registered and injected (it is annotated with `@DomainService`) so no further configuration is required.

If the menu items are not required then these can be suppressed either using security or by implementing a xref:ugbtb.adoc#_ugbtb_decoupling_vetoing-visibility[vetoing subscriber].

To use an alternative implementation, use
xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainServiceLayout_menuOrder[`@DomainServiceLayout#menuOrder()`] (as explained
in the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_intro_overriding-the-services[introduction] to this guide).




[[_rgsvc_api_LayoutService_related-mixins-and-menus]]
== Related Menus

The `TranslationServicePoMenu` menu exposes the `TranslationServicePo` service's `toPot()` method so that all
translations can be downloaded as a single file.



== Related Services

This service works in conjunction with xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_LocaleProvider[`LocaleProvider`] and xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_TranslationsResolver[`TranslationsResolver`] in order to provide i18n support.
