The `TranslationsResolver` service is one of the services that work together to implement Apache Isis' support for i18n, being used by Isis' default implementation of xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_TranslationService[`TranslationService`].

The role of the service itself is locate and return translations.


[NOTE]
====
For the "big picture" and further details on Apache Isis' i18n support, see xref:ugbtb.adoc#_ugbtb_i18n[here].

== SPI

The SPI defined by this service is:

[source,java]
----
public interface TranslationsResolver {
    @Programmatic
    List<String> readLines(final String file);
}
----


== Implementation

Isis' xref:ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] provides an implementation of this service (`TranslationsResolverWicket`) which leverages Apache Wicket APIs.  This searches for translation files in the standard `WEB-INF/` directory.

[NOTE]
====
Currently there is no equivalent implementation for the xref:ugvro.adoc#[RestfulObjects viewer].
====





== Registering the Service

Assuming that the `configuration-and-annotation` services installer is configured (implicit if using the
`AppManifest` to xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_AppManifest-bootstrapping[bootstrap the app]), _and_ that the xref:ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] is being used, then an implementation of `TranslationsResolver` is
automatically registered and injected (it is annotated with `@DomainService`) so no further configuration is required.

To use an alternative implementation, use
xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainServiceLayout_menuOrder[`@DomainServiceLayout#menuOrder()`] (as explained
in the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_intro_overriding-the-services[introduction] to this guide).






== Related Services


This service works in conjunction with xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_LocaleProvider[`LocaleProvider`] and xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_TranslationService[`TranslationService`] in order to provide i18n support.
