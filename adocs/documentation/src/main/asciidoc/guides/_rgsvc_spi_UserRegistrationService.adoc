The `UserRegistrationService` provides the ability for users to sign-up to access an application by providing a valid email address, and also provides the capability for users to reset their password if forgotten.

For user sign-up, the xref:ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] will check whether an implementation of this service (and also the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_EmailNotificationService[`EmailNotificationService`]) is available, and if so will render a sign-up page where the user enters their email address. A verification email is sent (using the aforementioned `EmailNotificationService`) which includes a link back to the running application; this allows the user then to complete their registration process (choose user name, password and so on). When the user has provided the additional details, the Wicket viewer calls _this_ service in order to create an account for them, and then logs the user on.

For the password reset feature, the Wicket viewer will render a password reset page, and use the `EmailNotificationService` to send a "password forgotten" email.  This service provides the ability to reset a password based on the user's email address.

It is of course possible for domain objects to use this service; it will be injected into domain object or other domain services in the usual way. That said, we expect that such use cases will be comparatively rare; the primary use case is for the Wicket viewer's sign-up page.

For further details on the user registration feature (as supported by the Wicket viewer), see xref:ugvw.adoc#_ugvw_features_user-registration[here].

== SPI

The SPI defined by the service is:

[source,java]
----
public interface UserRegistrationService {
    @Programmatic
    boolean usernameExists(String username);                                    // <1>
    @Programmatic
    boolean emailExists(String emailAddress);                                   // <2>
    @Programmatic
    void registerUser(String username, String password, String emailAddress);   // <3>
    @Programmatic
    boolean updatePasswordByEmail(String emailAddress, String password);        // <4>
}
----
<1> checks if there is already a user with the specified username
<2> checks if there is already a user with the specified email address
<3> creates the user, with specified password and email address. The username and email address must both be unique (not being used by an existing user)
<4> allows the user to reset their password




== Implementation

The core Apache Isis framework itself defines only an API; there is no default implementation. Rather, the implementation will depend on the security mechanism being used.

That said, if you have configured your app to use the http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-security[Isis addons security module], then note that the security module does provide an abstract implementation (`SecurityModuleAppUserRegistrationServiceAbstract`) of the `UserRegistrationService`. You will need to extend that service and provide implementation for the two abstract methods: `getInitialRole()` and `getAdditionalInitialRoles()`.

This is needed so that the self-registered users are assigned automatically to your application role(s) and be able to use the application. Without any role such user will be able only to see/use the logout link of the application.




== Registering the Services

There is no default implementation of this service provided by the core Apache Isis framework.

If using the (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-security[Isis addons' security] module) for
authentication and authorization, then note that it provides an adapter class,
`SecurityModuleAppUserRegistrationServiceAbstract`, that provides most of the implementation.  You are still required
to implement a subclass and register.

For example:

[source,java]
----
@DomainService(nature=NatureOfService.DOMAIN)
public class AppUserRegistrationService extends SecurityModuleAppUserRegistrationServiceAbstract {
    protected ApplicationRole getInitialRole() {
    return findRole("regular-user");
    }
    protected Set<ApplicationRole> getAdditionalInitialRoles() {
        return Collections.singleton(findRole("self-registered-user"));
    }
    private ApplicationRole findRole(final String roleName) {
        return applicationRoles.findRoleByName(roleName);
    }
    @Inject
    private ApplicationRoles applicationRoles;
}
----



== Related Services

The most common use case is to allow users to sign-up through Apache Isis' Wicket viewer. Because the process requires email to be sent, the following services must be configured:

* xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_EmailService[`EmailService`]
* xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_EmailNotificationService[`EmailNotificationService`]
* `UserRegistrationService` (this service)

The `EmailService` in particular requires additional xref:rgcfg.adoc#_rgcfg_configuring-core[configuration properties] to specify the external SMTP service.
