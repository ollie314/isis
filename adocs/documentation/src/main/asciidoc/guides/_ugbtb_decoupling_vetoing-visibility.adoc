NOTE: TODO - a write-up of the "vetoing subscriber" design pattern, eg as described in the  xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_BookmarkService[`BookmarkService`]


eg if included an addon such as auditing or security.

solution is to write a domain event subscriber that vetoes the visibility

All the addons actions inherit from common base classes so this can be as broad-brush or fine-grained as required
