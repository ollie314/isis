In addition to loading the regular configuration properties from `WEB-INF` directory (described
xref:rgcfg.adoc#_rgcfg_configuration-files[here]), Apache Isis will also load the `overrides.properties` file.

This file is treated slightly differently than the other configuration files; it is loaded last, and any configuration
properties defined in it will _override_ any configuration properties already read from other files (this includes
any properties specified via the command line).

While the regular configuration files are "baked into" the application WAR file, the `overrides.properties` file is
created dynamically as part of the Docker `ENTRYPOINT` script, eg as documented in the
link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/dockerfile_best-practices/[Dockerfile best practices].

This, Docker can be supported relatively trivially:

* use `mvn` (as currently) to create a WAR file; set up with the `pom.xml` with the JDBC drivers of all DB servers that
  you might want to connect to (hsqldb, sql server, postgresql etc)

* in the `Dockerfile`, specify a base image containing Tomcat 8 + Java 8 (say)

* also in the `Dockerfile`, arrange it such that the WAR file is "exploded" (there is no need to copy over the WAR file itself)

* write a script that:
** explodes the WAR file, copying it into the Tomcat's `webapp` directory.  There is no need to copy
over the WAR file itself.
** creates the `overrides.properties` file from any input arguments, placing it into the `WEB-INF` directory
** sets all files to read-only

* use `ENTRYPOINT` (and probably also `CMD`) to invoke above script.
