As described xref:rgcfg.adoc#_rgcfg_configuration-files[here], by default Apache Isis itself bootstraps from the
`isis.properties` configuration file.  It will also read configuration from the (optional)
component/implementation-specific configuration files (such as
`persistor_datanucleus.properties` or `viewer_wicket.properties`), and also (optional) component-specific configuration
files (such as `persistor.properties` or `viewer.properties`).

It's generally not good practice to have the same configuration property in more than one file, but if that does occur,
then the subsequent configuration property will be ignored.

[TIP]
====
In addition the framework will also load the `overrides.properties` file.  This is intended to support deployment
through Docker, as discussed xref:ugbtb.adoc#_ugbtb_deployment_docker[next].
====

All of these files are read from the `WEB-INF` directory.  Having this configuration "baked into" the application is
okay in a development environment, but when the app needs to be deployed to a test or production environment, this
configuration should be read from an external location.

There are in fact several frameworks involved here, all of which need to be pointed to this external location:

* Apache Isis itself, which (as already discussed) reads `isis.properties` and optional component-specific config files.

* link:http://shiro.apache.org[Apache Shiro],  which reads the `shiro.ini` file (and may read other files referenced from that file)

* http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2[Apache log4j 1.2], for logging, which reads `logging.properties` file

* although not used by Apache Isis, there's a good chance you may be using the Spring framework (eg if using http://activemq.apache.org[Apache Active MQ] or http://camel.apache.org[Apache Camel].

Each of these frameworks has its own way of externalizing its configuration.







[[_ugbtb_deployment_externalized-configuration_Isis]]
== Apache Isis' Config

To tell Apache Isis to load configuration from an external directory, specify the `isis.config.dir` context parameter.


If the external configuration directory is fixed for all environments (systest, UAT, prod etc), then you can specify within the `web.xml` itself:

[source,xml]
----
<context-param>
    <param-name>isis.config.dir</param-name>
    <param-value>location of external config directory</param-value>
</context-param>
----

If however the configuration directory varies by environment, then the context parameter will be specified to each installation of your servlet container. Most (if not all) servlet containers will provide a means to define context parameters through proprietary config files.

For example, if using Tomcat 7.0, you would typically copy the empty `$TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/conf/context.xml` to a file specific to the webapp, for example `$TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/conf/todo.xml`. The context parameter would then be specified by adding the following:

[source,xml]
----
<Parameter name="isis.config.dir"
           value="/usr/local/tomcat/myapp/conf/"
           override="false"/>
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Note that the `override` key should be set to "false", not "true".  It indicates whether the application's own `web.xml` can override the setting.  In most cases, you probably want to disallow that.
====


For more detail, see the Tomcat documentation on http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/config/context.html#Defining_a_context[defining a context] and on http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/config/context.html#Context_Parameters[context parameters].

[NOTE]
====
Note that running the app using Apache Isis' `org.apache.isis.WebServer` bootstrapper currently does not externalized Apache Isis configuration.
====






[[_ugbtb_deployment_externalized-configuration_Shiro]]
== Shiro Config

If using Apache Isis' xref:ugsec.adoc#_ugsec_configuring-isis-to-use-shiro[Shiro integration] for authentication and/or authorization, note that it reads from the `shiro.ini` configuration file. By default this also resides in `WEB-INF`.

Similar to Apache Isis, Shiro lets this configuration directory be altered, by specifying the `shiroConfigLocations` context parameter.

You can therefore override the default location using the same technique as described above for Apache Isis' `isis.config.dir` context parameter. For example:

[source,xml]
----
<Parameter name="shiroConfigLocations"
           value="file:/usr/local/myapp/conf/shiro.ini"
           override="false" />
----

[TIP]
====
Note that Shiro is more flexible than Apache Isis; it will read its configuration from any URL, not just a directory on the local filesystem.
====




[[_ugbtb_deployment_externalized-configuration_Log4j]]
== Log4j Config

By default Apache Isis configures log4j to read the `logging.properties` file in the `WEB-INF` directory. This can be overridden by setting the `log4j.properties` system property to the URL of the log4j properties file.

For example, if deploying to Tomcat7, this amounts to adding the following to the `CATALINA_OPTS` flags:

[source,bash]
----
export CATALINA_OPTS="-Dlog4j.configuration=/usr/local/tomcat/myapp/conf/logging.properties"
----

[TIP]
====
`CATALINA_OPTS` was called `TOMCAT_OPTS` in earlier versions of Tomcat.
====

Further details an be found in the link:https://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/manual.html#Example_Configurations[log4j documentation].




== Spring Config

Although Apache Isis does not use Spring, it's possible that your app may use other components that do use Spring.  For example, the (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-publishmq[Isis addons' publishmq] module uses ActiveMQ and Camel to support publishing; both of these leverage Spring.

There are several ways to externalized Spring config, but the mechanism described here is similar in nature to those that we use for externalizing Apache Isis' and Shiro's configuration.  In your `web.xml`, you will probably load the Spring application context using code such as:

[source,xml]
----
<listener>
    <listener-class>org.springframework.web.context.ContextLoaderListener</listener-class>
</listener>
<context-param>
    <param-name>contextConfigLocation</param-name>
    <param-value>
        classpath:my-application-context-config.xml
    </param-value>
</context-param>
----

Add a new application context `propertyPlaceholderConfigurer-config.xml` defining a `PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer` bean.

[source,xml]
----
<beans
  xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
  http://activemq.apache.org/schema/core http://activemq.apache.org/schema/core/activemq-core.xsd">
    <bean class="org.springframework.beans.factory.config.PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer">
        <property name="locations">
            <list>
                <value>${spring.config.file}</value>
            </list>
        </property>
    </bean>
</beans>
----

This reads the properties from a `spring.config.file`, defined as a context-param in the `web.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<context-param>
    <param-name>spring.config.file</param-name>
    <param-value>classpath:spring.properties</param-value>
</context-param>

----

Then update the bootstrapping in `web.xml` to use this new application context, eg:

[source,xml]
----
<context-param>
    <param-name>contextConfigLocation</param-name>
    <param-value>
        classpath:my-application-context-config.xml,
        classpath:propertyPlaceholderConfigurer-config.xml
    </param-value>
</context-param>
----

To use some other externalized configuration, override the `spring.config.file` property, eg using Tomcat's config file:

[source,xml]
----
<Parameter name="spring.config.dir"
           value="file:/usr/local/myapp/conf/spring.properties"
           override="false" />
----



=== An alternative approach

As mentioned, there are several other ways to externalize Spring's config; one approach is to use Spring's profile support.

For example, in the application context you could have:

[source,xml]
----
<beans profile="default">
    <bean class="org.springframework.beans.factory.config.PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer">
        <property name="locations">
            <list>
                <value>classpath:dev.properties</value>
            </list>
        </property>
    </bean>
</beans>
<beans profile="externalized">
    <bean id="propertyPlaceHolder" class="org.springframework.beans.factory.config.PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer">
        <property name="locations">
            <list>
                <value>classpath:prod.properties</value>
            </list>
        </property>
    </bean>
</beans>
----

The idea being that specifying the "prod" profile rather than the "default" profile would cause a different set of configuration properties to be read.

The active profile can be overridden with a system property, eg:

[source,bash]
----
-Dspring.active.profiles=prod
----


take a look at link:http://stackoverflow.com/a/10041835/56880[this SO answer] on using Spring profiles.
