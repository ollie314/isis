NOTE: TODO


The default JVM configuration will most likely not be appropriate for running Isis as a webapp.  The table below suggests some JVM args that you will probably want to modify:

.JVM args
[cols="1,1", options="header"]

|Flag
|Description

|-server
|Run the JVM in server mode, meaning that the JVM should spend more time on the optimization of the fragments of codes that are most often used (hotspots). This leads to better performance at the price of a higher overhead at startup.

|-Xms128m
Minimum heap size


|-Xmx768m
|Maximum heap size


|-XX:PermSize=64m
|Minimum perm size (for class definitions)


|-XX:MaxPermSize=256m
|Maximum perm size (for class definitions)


|-XX:+DisableExplicitGC
|Causes any explicit calls to <tt>System.gc()</tt> to be ignored.  +

There are also a whole bunch of GC-related flags, that you might want to explore; see this detailed link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tech/vmoptions-jsp-140102.html[Hotspot JVM] documentation and also this link:http://blog.ragozin.info/2011/09/hotspot-jvm-garbage-collection-options.html[blog post].



## Configuring in Tomcat

If using Tomcat, update the `CATALINA_OPTS` variable.  (This variable is also updated if xref:ugbtb.adoc#_ugbtb_deployment_externalized-configuration_Log4j[configuring logging to run externally]).
