Some pointers when deploying to Tomcat (or any other servlet container).

== Externalized Configuration

See the guidance xref:ugbtb.adoc#_ugbtb_deployment_externalized-configuration[below].

[source,ini]
----
-XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC

== Using a JNDI Datasource

See the guidance in the xref:rgcfg.adoc#_rgcfg_configuring-datanucleus_using-jndi-data-source[configuring datanucleus] section.
