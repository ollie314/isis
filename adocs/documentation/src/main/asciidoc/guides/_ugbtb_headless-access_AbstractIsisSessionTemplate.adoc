The `AbstractIsisSessionTemplate` class (whose name is inspired by the Spring framework's naming convention for similar classes that query http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/jdbc.html#jdbc-JdbcTemplate[JDBC], http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/jms.html#jms-jmstemplate[JMS], http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/orm.html#orm-jpa-template[JPA] etc.) provides the mechanism to open up a 'session' within the Apache Isis framework, in order to resolve and interact with entities.

The class itself is intended to be subclassed:

[source,java]
----
public abstract class AbstractIsisSessionTemplate {

    public void execute(final AuthenticationSession authSession, final Object context) { ... } //<1>
    protected abstract void doExecute(Object context); // <2>

    protected ObjectAdapter adapterFor(final Object targetObject) { ... }
    protected ObjectAdapter adapterFor(final RootOid rootOid) { ... }

    protected PersistenceSession getPersistenceSession() { ... }
    protected IsisTransactionManager getTransactionManager() { ... }
    protected AdapterManager getAdapterManager() { ... }
}
----
<1> `execute(...)` sets up the `IsisSession` and delegates to ...
<2> `doExecute(...)`, the mandatory hook method for subclasses to implement.
The passed object represents passes a context from the caller (eg the scheduler, cron job, JMS etc) that instantiated and executed the class.

The `protected` methods expose key internal APIs within Apache Isis, for the subclass to use as necessary.


[TIP]
====
One notable feature of `AbstractIsisSessionTemplate` is that it will automatically inject any domain services into itself. Thus, it is relatively easy for the subclass to "reach into" the domain, through injected repository services.
