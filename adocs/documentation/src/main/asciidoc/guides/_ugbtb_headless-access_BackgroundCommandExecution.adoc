The `BackgroundCommandExecution` class (a subclass of xref:ugbtb.adoc#_ugbtb_headless-access_AbstractIsisSessionTemplate[AbstractIsisSessionTemplate]) is intended to simplify the execution of background ``Command``s persisted by way of the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_CommandService[`CommandService`] and the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_BackgroundCommandService[`BackgroundCommandService`].

Its signature is:

[source,java]
----
public abstract class BackgroundCommandExecution extends AbstractIsisSessionTemplate {
    protected void doExecute(Object context) { ... }
    protected abstract List<? extends Command> findBackgroundCommandsToExecute(); // <1>
}
----
<1> `findBackgroundCommandsToExecute()` is a mandatory hook method for subclasses to implement.

This allows for different implementations of the `CommandService` and `BackgroundCommandService` to persist to wherever.

The diagram below (http://yuml.me/edit/363b335f[yuml.me/363b335f]) shows the dependencies between these various classes:

== Background Execution

The `BackgroundCommandExecutionFromBackgroundCommandServiceJdo` is a concrete subclass of `BackgroundCommandExecution` (see the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_BackgroundService[`BackgroundCommandService`]), the intended use being for the class to be instantiated regularly (eg every 10 seconds) by a scheduler such as http://quartz-scheduler.org[Quartz]) to poll for ``Command``s to be executed, and then execute them.

This implementation queries for ``Command``s persisted by the link:http://www.isisaddons.org/isis-module-command[Isis addons Command Module]'s  implementations of xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_CommandService[`CommandService`] and xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_BackgroundCommandService[`BackgroundCommandService`] using the `BackgroundCommandServiceJdoRepository`.

The diagram below (link:http://yuml.me/edit/25343da1[yuml.me/25343da1]) shows the inheritance hierarchy for this class:
