In Apache Isis, every interaction (action invocation or property edit) is automatically wrapped in a transaction,
and any repository query automatically does a flush before hand.

What that means is that there's no need to explicitly start or commit transactions in Apache Isis; this will be done
for you. Indeed, if you do try to manage transactions (eg by reaching into the JDO `PersistenceManager` exposed by the
xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_IsisJdoSupport[IsisJdoSupport] domain service, then you are likely to confuse the
framework and get a stack trace for your trouble.

However, you can complete a given transaction and start a new one.  This is sometimes useful if writing a fixture
script which is going to perform some sort of bulk migration of data from an old system.  For this use case, use the
xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_TransactionService[`TransactionService`].

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class SomeLongRunningFixtureScript extends FixtureScript

    protected void execute(final ExecutionContext executionContext) {
        // do some work
        transactionService.nextTransaction();
        // do some work
        transactionService.nextTransaction();
        // do yet more work
    }

    @javax.inject.Inject
    TransactionService transactionService;
}
----

You get the idea.


== Raise message/errors to users

The framework provides the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_MessageService[`MessageService`] as a means to return an out-of-band
message to the end-user.  In the xref:ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] these are shown as "toast" pop-ups; the
xref:ugvro.adoc#[Restful Objects viewer] returns an HTTP header.

The `UserService` provides three APIs, for different:

* `informUser()` - an informational message.  In the Wicket viewer these are short-lived pop-ups that disappear after a short time.
* `warnUser()` - a warning.  In the Wicket viewer these do not auto-close; they must be acknowledged.
* `raiseError()` - an error.  In the Wicket viewer these do not auto-close; they must be acknowledged.

Each pop-up has a different background colour indicating its severity.

None of these messages/errors has any influence on the transaction; any changes to objects will be committed.


== Aborting transactions

If you want to abort Apache Isis' transaction, this can be done by throwing an exception.  The exception message
is displayed to the user on the error page (if xref:ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer]) or a 500 status error code (if the
xref:ugvro.adoc#[Restful Objects] viewer).

If the exception thrown is because of an unexpected error (eg a `NullPointerException` in the domain app itself), then
the error page will include a stack trace.  If however you want to indicate that the exception is in some sense
"expected", then throw a `RecoverableException` (or any subclass, eg `ApplicationException`); the stack trace will then
be suppressed from the error page.

Another way in which exceptions might be considered "expected" could be as the result of attempting to persist an
object which then violates some type of database constraint.  Even if the domain application checks beforehand, it
could be that another user operating on the object at the same moment of time might result in the conflict.

To handle this the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_ExceptionRecognizer[`ExceptionRecognizer`] SPI can be used.  The
framework provides a number of implementations out-of-the-box; whenever an exception is thrown it is passed to each
known recognizer implementation to see if it recognizes the exception and can return a user-meaningful error message.
For example, `ExceptionRecognizerForSQLIntegrityConstraintViolationUniqueOrIndexException` checks if the
exception inherits from `java.sql.SQLIntegrityConstraintViolationException`, and if so, constructs a suitable message.
