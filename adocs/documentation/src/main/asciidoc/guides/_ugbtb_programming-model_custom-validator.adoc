Apache Isis' programming model includes a validator component that detects and prevents (by failing fast) a number of situations where the domain model is logically inconsistent.

For example, the validator will detect any orphaned supporting methods (eg `hideXxx()`) if the corresponding property or action has been renamed or deleted but the supporting method was not also updated.  Another example is that a class cannot have a title specified both using `title()` method and also using `@Title` annotation.

[NOTE]
====
The support for xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-aaa_deprecated[disallowing deprecated annotations] is also implemented using the metamodel validator.
====

You can also impose your own application-specific rules by installing your own metamodel validator.  To give just one example, you could impose naming standards such as ensuring that a domain-specific abbreviation such as "ISBN" is always consistently capitalized wherever it appears in a class member.

[TIP]
====
Isis' xref:rgmvn.adoc[Maven plugin] will also validate the domain object model during build time.

== API and Implementation

There are several ways to go about implementing a validator.

=== `MetaModelValidator`

Any custom validator must implement Apache Isis' internal `MetaModelValidator` interface, so the simplest option is just to implement `MetaModelValidator` directly:


[source,java]
----
public interface MetaModelValidator
        implements SpecificationLoaderSpiAware { // <1>
    public void validate(
        ValidationFailures validationFailures);  // <2>
}
----
<1> the `SpecificationLoader` is the internal API providing access to the Apache Isis metamodel.
<2> add any metamodel violations to the `ValidationFailures` parameter (the link:http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?CollectingParameter[collecting parameter] pattern)


=== `Visitor`

More often than not, you'll want to visit every element in the metamodel, and so for this you can instead subclass from `MetaModelValidatorVisiting.Visitor`:

[source,java]
----
public final class MetaModelValidatorVisiting ... {
    public static interface Visitor {
        public boolean visit(                       // <1>
            ObjectSpecification objectSpec,         // <2>
            ValidationFailures validationFailures); // <3>
    }
    ...
}
----
<1> return `true` continue visiting specs.
<2> `ObjectSpecification` is the internal API representing a class
<3> add any metamodel violations to the `ValidationFailures` parameter


You can then create your custom validator by subclassing `MetaModelValidatorComposite` and adding the visiting validator:

[source,java]
----
public class MyMetaModelValidator extends MetaModelValidatorComposite {
    public MyMetaModelValidator() {
        add(new MetaModelValidatorVisiting(new MyVisitor()));
    }
}
----

If you have more than one rule then each can live in its own visitor.

=== `SummarizingVisitor`

As a slight refinement, you can also subclass from `MetaModelValidatorVisiting.SummarizingVisitor`:

[source,java]
----
public final class MetaModelValidatorVisiting ... {
    public static interface SummarizingVisitor extends Visitor {
        public void summarize(ValidationFailures validationFailures);
    }
    ...
}
----

A `SummarizingVisitor` will be called once after every element in the metamodel has been visited.  This is great for performing checks on the metamodel as a whole.  For example, Apache Isis uses this to check that there is at least one `@Persistable` domain entity defined.




== Configuration

Once you have implemented your validator, you must register it with the framework by defining the appropriate configuration property:

[source,ini]
----
isis.reflector.validator=com.mycompany.myapp.MyMetaModelValidator
----
