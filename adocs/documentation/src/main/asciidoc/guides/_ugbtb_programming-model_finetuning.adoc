The core metamodel defines APIs and implementations for building the Apache Isis metamodel: a description of the set of entities, domain services and values that make up the domain model.


The description of each domain class consists of a number of elements:

https://github.com/apache/isis/blob/master/core/metamodel/src/main/java/org/apache/isis/core/metamodel/spec/ObjectSpecification.java[ObjectSpecification]::
Analogous to `java.lang.Class`; holds information about the class itself and holds collections of each of the three types of class' members (below);

https://github.com/apache/isis/blob/master/core/metamodel/src/main/java/org/apache/isis/core/metamodel/spec/feature/OneToOneAssociation.java[OneToOneAssociation]::
Represents a class member that is a single-valued property of the class. The property's type is either a reference to another entity, or is a value type.

https://github.com/apache/isis/blob/master/core/metamodel/src/main/java/org/apache/isis/core/metamodel/spec/feature/OneToManyAssociation.java[OneToManyAssociation]::
Represents a class member that is a collection of references to other entities. Note that Apache Isis does not currently support collections of values.

https://github.com/apache/isis/blob/master/core/metamodel/src/main/java/org/apache/isis/core/metamodel/spec/feature/ObjectAction.java[ObjectAction]::
Represents a class member that is an operation that can be performed on the action. Returns either a single value, a collection of entities, or is `void`.


The metamodel is built up through the https://github.com/apache/isis/blob/master/core/metamodel/src/main/java/org/apache/isis/core/metamodel/progmodel/ProgrammingModel.java[ProgrammingModel], which defines an API for registering a set of https://github.com/apache/isis/blob/master/core/metamodel/src/main/java/org/apache/isis/core/metamodel/facets/FacetFactory.java[FacetFactory]s.  Two special `FacetFactory` implementations - https://github.com/apache/isis/blob/master/core/metamodel/src/main/java/org/apache/isis/core/metamodel/facets/properties/accessor/PropertyAccessorFacetViaAccessorFactory.java[PropertyAccessorFacetFactory] and https://github.com/apache/isis/blob/master/core/metamodel/src/main/java/org/apache/isis/core/metamodel/facets/collections/accessor/CollectionAccessorFacetViaAccessorFactory.java[CollectionAccessorFacetFactory] - are used to identify the class members.
Pretty much all the other ``FacetFactory``s are responsible for installing https://github.com/apache/isis/blob/master/core/metamodel/src/main/java/org/apache/isis/core/metamodel/facetapi/Facet.java[Facet]s onto the metamodel elements.

There are many many such ``Facet``s, and are used to do such things get values from properties or collections, modify properties or collections, invoke action, hide or disable class members, provide UI hints for class members, and so on. In short, the ``FacetFactory``s registered defines the Apache Isis programming conventions.



== Modifying the Prog. Model

The default implementation of `ProgrammingModel` is https://github.com/apache/isis/blob/master/core/metamodel/src/main/java/org/apache/isis/progmodels/dflt/ProgrammingModelFacetsJava5.java[ProgrammingModelFacetsJava5], which registers a large number of ``FacetFactory``s.

By editing `isis.properties` you can modify the programming conventions either by (a) using the default programming model, but tweaking it to include new `FacetFactory`s or exclude existing, or (b) by specifying a completely different programming model implementation.

Let's see how this is done.

=== Including or excluding facets

Suppose that you wanted to completely remove support for the (already deprecated) `@ActionOrder` annotation. This would be done using:

[source,ini]
----
isis.reflector.facets.exclude=org.apache.isis.core.metamodel.facets.object.actionorder.annotation.ActionOrderFacetAnnotationFactory
----

Or, suppose you wanted to use the example https://github.com/apache/isis/blob/master/mothballed/misc/metamodel/namefile/src/main/java/org/apache/isis/example/metamodel/namefile/facets/NameFileFacetFactory.java["namefile"] `FacetFactory` as part of your programming conventions, use:

[source,ini]
----
isis.reflector.facets.include=org.apache.isis.example.metamodel.namefile.facets.NameFileFacetFactory
----

To include/exclude more than one `FacetFactory`, specify as a comma-separated list.

[TIP]
====
This http://isis.markmail.org/thread/472c3mrvcgnripst[thread] from the users mailing list (in Apr 2014) shows a typical customization (to enable per-instance security) (though note that xref:ugbtb.adoc#_ugbtb_other-techniques_multi-tenancy[Multi-Tenancy] is now a better solution to that particular use-case.

[NOTE]
====
Previously (prior to `1.13.0`) the framework also supported the "isis.reflector.facets" configuration property, to
specify a completely new implementation of the (internal API) `ProgrammingModel`.  This is no longer supported; use
"isis.reflector.facets.include" and "isis.reflector.facet.exclude" to adjust the framework's default implementation
(called `ProgrammingModelFacetsJava5`).
