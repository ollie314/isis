View models are a type of domain object (with state, behaviour etc) but where the state is _not_ persisted into the
 JDO/DataNucleus-managed database, but is instead converted to/from a string memento, and held by the calling client.
This opens up a number of more advanced use cases.

In this topic we'll explore those use cases, and learn the programming model and conventions to use view models in your application.
