So much for the theory; how should view models be implemented?  Fundamentally all view models' state is serialized into
a string memento; this memento is then held by the client (browser) in the form of a URL.  As you might imagine, this
URL can become quite long, but Apache Isis offers a mechanism (the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_UrlEncodingService[`UrlEncodingService`]) if it exceeds the maximum length for a URL
(2083 characters).  Also, of course, this string memento must only contain characters that it is valid for use within
a URL.

While the underlying technique is the same irrespective of use case, the programming model provides various ways of
defining a view model so that the original intent is not lost.  They are:

.View model programming model
[cols="1a,4a,2a", options="header"]
|===

| Use case
| Code
| Description


| External entity
|[source,java]
----
@DomainObject(nature=Nature.EXTERNAL_ENTITY)
public class CustomerRecordOnSAP { ... }
----
|Annotated with xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainObject_nature[`@DomainObject#nature()`] and a nature of `EXTERNAL_ENTITY`, with memento derived automatically from the properties of the domain object.  Collections are ignored, as are any properties annotated as xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Property_notPersisted[not persisted].

| In-memory entity
|[source,java]
----
@DomainObject(nature=Nature.INMEMORY_ENTITY)
public class Log4JAppender { ... }
----
|As preceding, but using a nature of `INMEMORY_ENTITY`.

|Application view model
|[source,java]
----
@DomainObject(nature=Nature.VIEW_MODEL)
public class Dashboard { ... }
----
|As preceding, but using a nature of `VIEW_MODEL`.

|Application view model
|
[source,java]
----
@ViewModel
public class Dashboard { ... }
----

|Annotated with xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-ViewModel[`@ViewModel`] annotation (effectively just an alias)' memento is as preceding: from "persisted" properties, collections ignored

|Application view model
|
[source,java]
----
public class ExcelUploadManager implements ViewModel {
  public String viewModelMemento() { ... }
  public void viewModelInit(String memento) { ... }
}
|Implement xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_super_ViewModel[`ViewModel`] interface.  The memento is as defined by the
interface's methods: the programmer has full control (but also full responsibility) for the string memento.

|DTO
|
[source,java]
----
@XmlRootElement("customer")
public class CustomerDto { ... }
----
|Annotate using JAXB xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-XmlRootElement[`@XmlRootElement`] annotation.  Memento
derived automatically by serializing the XML graph as implied by the JAXB annotations.  Note that (unlike `@ViewModel`
et al) this state _can_ include collections.

JAXB-annotated DTOs are discussed in more detail immediately xref:rg.adoc#_ugbtb_view-models_jaxb[below].
