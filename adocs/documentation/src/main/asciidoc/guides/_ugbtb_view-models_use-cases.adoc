When developing an Apache Isis application you will most likely start off with the persistent domain entities:
`Customer`, `Order`, `Product`, and so on.  For some applications this may well suffice.  However, if the application
needs to integrate with other systems, or if the application needs to support reasonably complex business processes, then you may need to look beyond just domain entities.  This section explores these use cases.

[[_ugbtb_view-models_use-cases_externally-managed-entities]]
== Externally-managed entities

Sometimes the entities that make up your application are persisted not in the local JDO/DataNucleus database
but reside in some other system, for example accessible only through a SOAP web service.  Logically that data
might still be considered a domain entity and we might want to associate behaviour with it, however it cannot be
modelled as a domain entity if only because JDO/DataNucleus doesn't know about the entity nor how to retrieve or
update it.

There are a couple of ways around this: we could either replicate the data somehow from the external system into the
 Isis-managed database (in which case it is once again just another domain entity), or we could set up a stub/proxy for
 the externally managed entity.  This proxy would hold the reference to the externally-managed domain entity (eg an
 external id), as well as the "smarts" to know how to interact with that entity (by making SOAP web service calls etc).

The stub/proxy is a type of view model: a view - if you like - onto the domain entity managed by the external system.

[NOTE]
====
DataNucleus does in fact define its own link:http://www.datanucleus.org/documentation/extensions/store_manager.html[Store Manager] extension point, so an alternative architecture would be to implement this interface such that DataNucleus
could make the calls to the external system; these externally-persisted domain entities would therefore be modelled as regular `@PersistenceCapable` entities after all.  For entities not persisted externally the implementation would delegate down to the default RDBMS-specific `StoreManager` provided by DataNucleus itself.

An implementation that supported only reading from an external entity ought to be comparatively straight-forward, but
implementing one that also supported updating external entities would need to carefully consider error conditions if the
external system is unavailable; distributed transactions are most likely difficult/impossible to implement (and not
desirable in any case).

[[_ugbtb_view-models_use-cases_in-memory-entities]]
== In-memory entities

As a variation on the above, sometimes there are domain objects that are, conceptually at least entities, but whose
state is not actually persisted anywhere, merely held in-memory (eg in a hash).

A simple example might be read-only configuration data that is read from a config file (eg log4j appender
definitions) but thereafter is presented in the UI just like any other entity.


[[_ugbtb_view-models_use-cases_application-layer-view-models]]
== Application-layer view models

Domain entities (whether locally persisted using JDO/DataNucleus or managed externally) are the bread-and-butter of Apache Isis applications: the focus after all, should be on the business domain concepts and ensuring that they are
solid.  Generally those domain entities will make sense to the business domain experts: they form the _ubiquitous language_ of the domain.  These domain entities are part of the domain layer.

That said, it may not always be practical to expect end-users of the application to interact solely with those domain
entities.  For example, it may be useful to show a dashboard of the most significant data in the system to a user,
often pulling in and aggregating information from multiple points of the app.  Obtaining this information by hand (by
 querying the respective services/repositories) would be tedious and slow; far better to have a dashboard do the job for
 the end user.

A dashboard object is a model of the most relevant state to the end-user, in other words it is (quite literally) a view
 model.  It is not a persisted entity, instead it belongs to the application layer.

A view model need not merely aggregate data; it could also provide actions of its own.  Most likely these actions will
be queries and will always ultimately just delegate down to the appropriate domain-layer service/repository.  But in
some cases such view model actions might also modify state of underlying domain entities.

Another common use for view models is to help co-ordinate complex business processes; for example to perform a
quarterly invoicing run, or to upload annual interest rates from an Excel spreadsheet.  In these cases the view model
might have some state of its own, but in most cases that state does not need to be persisted per se.

.Desire Lines
****
One way to think of application view models is as modelling the "desire line": the commonly-trod path
that end-users must follow to get from point A to point B as quickly as possible.

To explain: there are link:http://ask.metafilter.com/62599/Where-the-sidewalk-ends[documented]
link:https://sivers.org/walkways[examples]
link:http://www.softpanorama.org/People/Wall/larry_wall_articles_and_interviews.shtml[that] architects of university
campus will only add in paths some while after the campus buildings are complete: let the pedestrians figure out the
routes they want to take.  The name we like best for this idea is "desire lines", though it has also been called
a "desire path", "paving the path" or "paving the sidewalk".

What that means is you should add view models _after_ having built up the domain layer, rather than before.  These view
models pave that commonly-trod path, automating the steps that the end-user would otherwise have to do by hand.

It takes a little practice though, because even when building the domain layer "first", you should still bear in mind
what the use cases are that those domain entities are trying to support.  You certainly _shouldn't_ try to build out a
domain layer that could support every conceivable use case before starting to think about view models.

Instead, you should iterate.  Identify the use case/story/end-user objective that you will deliver value to the
business.  Then build out the minimum domain entities to support that use case (refining the xref:ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_core-concepts_philosophy_domain-driven-design_ubiquitous-language[ubiquitous language] as you
go).  Then, identify if there any view models that could be introduced which would simplify the end-user interactions
with the system (perhaps automating several related use cases together).

[[_ugbtb_view-models_use-cases_dtos]]
== DTOs

DTOs (data transfer objects) are simple classes that (according to link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transfer_object[wikipedia]) "carry data between processes".

If those two processes are parts of the same overall application (the same team builds and deploys both server and
client) then there's generally no need to define a DTO; just access the entities using Apache Isis'
xref:ugvro.adoc#[RestfulObjects viewer].

On the other hand, if the client consuming the DTO is a different application -- by which we mean developed/deployed by
a different (possible third-party) team -- then the DTOs act as a formal contract between the provider and the consumer.
In such cases, exposing domain entities over xref:ugvro.adoc#[RestfulObjects] would be
"A Bad Thing"(TM) because the consumer would in effect have access to implementation details that could then not be
easily changed by the producer.

To support this use case, a view model can be defined such that it can act as a DTO.  This is done by annotating the
class using JAXB annotations; this allows the consumer to obtain the DTO in XML format along with a corresponding
XSD schema describing the structure of that XML.  A discussion of how that might be done using an ESB such as
link:http://camel.apache.org[Apache Camel(TM)] follows xref:ugbtb.adoc#_ugbtb_view-models_use-cases_dtos_consumers[below].

In case it's not obvious, these DTOs are still usable as "regular" view models; they will render in the xref:ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] just like any other.  In fact (as the xref:ugbtb.adoc#_ugbtb_view-models_programming-model[programming model] section below makes clear), these JAXB-annotated view models are in many regards the most powerful of all the alternative ways of writing view models.


It's also worth noting that it is also possible to download the XML (or XSD) straight from the UI, useful during development.
The view model simply needs to implement the xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_mixins_Dto[`Dto`] marker interface; the
framework has xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_mixins_Dto[mixins] that contribute the download actions to the view model.


[[_ugbtb_view-models_use-cases_dtos_consumers]]
=== DTO Consumers

The actual consumers of DTOs will generally obtain the XML of the view models either by requesting the XML directly,
eg using the xref:ugvro.adoc#[RestfulObjects viewer], or may have the XML sent to them asynchronously using an ESB
such as Apache Camel.

In the former case, the consumer requests the DTO by calling the REST API with the appropriate HTTP `Accept` header.
An appropriate implementation of xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_ContentMappingService[`ContentMappingService`] can then be
used to return the appropriate DTO (as XML).

For the latter case, one design is simply for the application to instantiate the view model, then call the
xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_JaxbService[`JaxbService`] to obtain its corresponding XML.  This can then be published onto
the ESB, for example using an http://activemq.apache.org[Apache ActiveMQ (TM)] queue.

However, rather than try to push all the data that might be needed by any of these external systems in a single XML event
 (which would require anticipating all the requirements, likely a hopeless task), a better design is to publish only
 the fact that something of note has changed - ie, that an action on a domain object has been invoked - and then let the consumers call back to obtain other information if required.  This can once again be done by calling the REST API with
 an appropriate HTTP `Accept` header.

[TIP]
====
This is an example of the link:https://leanpub.com/camel-design-patterns[VETRO pattern] (validate, enrich, transform, route, operate).  In our case we focus on the validation (to determine the nature of the inbound message, ie which action was
invoked), and the enrich (callback to obtain a DTO with additional information required by the consumer).
====

The (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-publishmq[Isis addons' publishmq] module provides an out-of-the-box solution of this design.  It provides an implementation of the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_PublishingService[`PublishingService`],
but which simply publishes instances of xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_schema-aim[`ActionInvocationMemento`] to an ActiveMQ
queue.  Camel (or similar) can then be hooked up to consume these events from this queue, and use a processor to
parse the action memento to determine what has changed on the source system.  Thereafter, a subsequent Camel processor
can then call back to the source - via the xref:ugvro.adoc[Restful Objects viewer] - to enrich the message with
additional details using a DTO.
