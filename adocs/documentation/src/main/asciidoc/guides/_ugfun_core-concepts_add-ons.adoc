The link:http://www.isisaddons.org[Isis Addons] website provides a number of reusable modules and other extensions for Apache Isis.  This chapter focuses just on the modules, all of which have a name of the form `isis-module-xxx`.

[WARNING]

The modules themselves fall into four broad groups:

* modules that provide an implementations of API defined by Apache Isis +
+
where Apache Isis has hooks to use the service if defined by provides no implementations of its own.  The http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-command[command], http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-audit[auditing], http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-publishing[publishing], http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-security[security]  and http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-sessionlogger[sessionlogger] modules fall into this category.  Typically the domain objects themselves wouldn't interact with these services

* modules that provide standalone domain services with their own API and implementation +
+
These are simply intended to be used by domain objects.  The http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-docx[docx], http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-excel[excel], http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-settings[settings] and http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-stringinterpolator[stringinterpolator] fall into this category.

* modules that provide standalone domain entities (and supporting services) for a particular subdomain +
+
The http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-tags[tags] module falls into this category

* modules that provide developer utilities +
+
Not intended for use by either the framework or domain objects, but provide utilities that the developer themselves might use.  The http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-devutils[devutils] module (not suprisingly) falls into this category

Each of the modules has a full README and example application demonstrating their usage.  The sections below briefly outline the capabilities of these modules.
