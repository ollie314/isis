In this section we run through the main building blocks that make up an Apache Isis application.

[[_ugfun_core-concepts_building-blocks_metamodel]]
== A MetaModel

At its core, Apache Isis is a metamodel that is built at runtime from the domain classes (eg `Customer.java`), along
with optional supporting metadata (eg `Customer.layout.json`).

The contents of this metamodel is inferred from the Java classes discovered on the classpath: the entities and
supporting services, as well the members of those classes.  The detail of the metamodel is generally explicit, usually
represented by Java annotations such as `@Title` or `@Action`.  Notably the metamodel is
xref:ugbtb.adoc#_ugbtb_programming-model[extensible]; it is possible to teach Apache Isis new programming
conventions/rules (and conversely to remove those that are built in).

Most of the annotations recognized by the framework are defined by the Apache Isis framework itself.  For example the
`@Title` annotation - which identifies how the framework should derive a human-readable label for each rendered
domain object - is part of the `org.apache.isis.applib.annotations` package.  However the framework also recognizes
certain other JEE annotations such as `@javax.inject.Inject` (used for dependency injection).

The framework uses DataNucleus for its persistence mechanism.  This is an ORM that implements the JDO and JPA APIs, and
which can map domain objects either to an RDBMS or to various NoSQL objectstores such as MongoDB or Neo4J.  Apache Isis
recognizes a number of the JDO annotations such as `@javax.jdo.annotations.Column(allowsNull=...)`.

In addition, the framework builds up the metamodel for each domain object using
xref:ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_object-layout[layout hints], such as `Customer.layout.json`.  These provide metadata such as
grouping elements of the UI together, using multi-column layouts, and so on.  The layout file can be modified while the
application is still running, and are picked up automatically; a useful way to speed up feedback.

[TIP]
====
At the time of writing Apache Isis only recognizes and supports the JDO API, though we expect JPA to be supported
in the future.  We also expect to generalize support for `.layout.json` to be able to read such metadata from other
sources.

[[_ugfun_core-concepts_building-blocks_types-of-domain-objects]]
== Type of Domain Objects

Most domain objects that the end-user interacts with are *domain entities*, such as `Customer`, `Order`, `Product` and
so on.  These are persistent objects and which are mapped to a database (usually relational), using JDO/DataNucleus
annotations.  From the end-user's perspective the UI displays a single domain object per page; they can then inspect
and modify its state, and navigate to related objects.

The next type of domain object to discuss is *domain services*.  These are (usually) singleton stateless services
that provide additional functionality.  The behaviour of these services is rendered in various ways, though the most
obvious is as the menu actions on the top-level menu bars in the xref:ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer]'s UI.

Domain objects can also delegate to domain services; domain services are automatically injected into every other domain
object; this includes domain entities as well as other services.  This injection of domain services into entities is
significant: it allows business logic to be implemented in the domain entities, rather than have it "leach away" into
supporting service layers.  Said another way: it is the means by which Apache Isis helps you avoid the anaemic
domain model anti-pattern.

As well as domain entities - mapped to a datastore - Apache Isis also supports *view models*.  End users interact with
view models in the same way as a domain entity, indeed they are unlikely to distinguish one from the other.  However
view models are _not_ mapped to the underlying database, rather they represent some aggregation of state from one or
more underlying entities.  Their state is serialized and recreated from their internal identifier; this identifier is
visible as the object's URL in the xref:ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] or
xref:ugvro.adoc#[RestfulObjects viewer].

There's no need though for the view model to aggregate the state of regular domain entities.  A view model could also
be used as a proxy for some externally managed entity, accessed over a web service or REST API; it could even be a
representation of state held in-memory (such as user preferences, for example).

There are also several types of domain services.  Most easily described are those domain services (discussed above)
that are represented as the menu actions on top-level menu bars.  Another variation are *contributed services* - domain
services that contribute behaviour or (derived) state to entities/view models.  Finally domain services may also
simply provide additional non-UI functionality; an example being to perform an address geocoding lookup against the
google-maps API.

Also worth mentioning: domain services can also be either singletons (discussed above) or request-scoped; the latter
being annotated with `@javax.enterprise.context.RequestScoped`.  An example of the request-scoped service is the
xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_Scratchpad[`Scratchpad`] service, for sharing arbitrary data between multiple objects.

The final type of domain object is the *mixin*.  These are similar to contributed services in that they also contribute (or rather,
mixin) both behaviour or (derived) state to entities/view models.  However, they provide a more control over contributed services,
with a cleaner programming model similar to traits found in other languages.

The diagram below summarizes the various types of domain object:

image::{_imagesdir}core-concepts/building-blocks/types-of-domain-object.png[width="860px",link="{_imagesdir}core-concepts/building-blocks/types-of-domain-object.png"]


The Apache Isis programming model uses annotations to distinguish these object types:

* *view models* are annotated either with `@DomainObject(nature=VIEW_MODEL)` or using `@ViewModel`.  Which is used is
a matter of personal preference.  +
+
It is also possible to implement the `ViewModel` interface, for finer-grained control.

* *domain entities* that are persisted to the database (as the vast majority will) are annotated with
`@DomainObject(nature=ENTITY)`. In addition such domain entities are annotated with the JDO/DataNucleus annotation of
`@javax.jdo.annotations.PersistenceCapable`. +
+
In addition, if a domain entity is a proxy for state managed in an external system, or merely for some state held
in-memory, then `@DomainObject(nature=EXTERNAL_ENTITY)` or `@DomainObject(nature=INMEMORY_ENTITY)` can be used.

* *mixins* are annotated either with `@DomainObject(nature=MIXIN)` or using `@Mixin`.  As for view models, which is
used is a matter of personal preference.

* finally, *domain services*` are annotated with `@DomainService(nature=...)` where the nature is either
`VIEW_MENU_ONLY` (for domain services whose actions appear on the top-level menu bars), or `VIEW_CONTRIBUTIONS_ONLY`
(for domain services whose actions are contributed to entities or view models), or `DOMAIN` (for domain services whose
functionality is simply for other domain objects to invoke programmatically).
+
It is also possible to specify a nature of simply `VIEW`, this combining `VIEW_MENU_ONLY` and `VIEW_CONTRIBUTIONS_ONLY`.
This is in fact the default, useful for initial prototyping.  A final nature is `VIEW_REST_ONLY` which is for domain
services whose functionality is surfaced only by the xref:ugvro.adoc#[RestfulObjects viewer].

Worth emphasising is that domain entities and view models hold state, whereas domain services are generally
stateless.  If a domain service does hold state (eg the `Scratchpad` service noted above) then it should be
`@RequestScoped` so that this state is short-lived and usable only within a single request.



[[_ugfun_core-concepts_building-blocks_objects-members]]
== Object Members

Every domain object in Apache Isis consists of (at most) three types of members:

* properties, such as a `Customer`'s `firstName

* collections, such as a `Customer`'s `orders` collection of ``Order``s

* actions, such as a `Customer'`s `placeOrder(...)` method.

Some domain objects - specifically domain services and mixins - only have actions.  In the case of contributing services
and mixins these actions can (depending upon their semantics and signatures) be represented as derived properties or
collections on the entity/view model to which they contribute/mix-in.


=== Properties

Properties follow the standard getter/setter pattern, with the return type being a scalar (a value object or another
entity or view model).

For example, with:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer
    private String firstName;
    public String getFirstName() { return firstName; }
    public void setFirstName(String firstName) { this.firstName = firstName; }
    ...
}
----

the framework infers the `Customer` domain entity, which in turn has a `firstName` string _property_.


=== Collections

Collections are also represented by a getter and setter, however the return type is a `Collection` or subtype.

For example, with:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer
    private SortedSet<Order> orders = new TreeSet<Order>();
    public SortedSet<Order> getOrders() { return orders; }
    public void setOrders(SortedSet<Order> orders) { this.orders = orders; }
    ...
}
----

the framework infers the `orders` _collection_.

[TIP]
====
The most commonly used collection type is `java.util.SortedSet`; entities are most commonly mapped to a relational
database (ie a datastore with set semantics) and we recommend that all entities define a natural ordering so that when
rendered in the UI they will be ordered "meaningfully" to the end-user.
====


=== Actions

The third type of object member is actions.  (To a first approximation), actions are all public methods that do not
represent properties or collections.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer
    public Customer placeOrder(Product p, int quantity) { ... }
    ...
}
----

corresponds to the `placeOrder` _action_.

[NOTE]
====
The above _is_ a simplification; the Apache Isis programming model also recognizes a number of other supporting methods
each of which has its own prefix such as `hide`, `disable` or `validate`.  These can be considered as "reserved words"
in Apache Isis, and do _not_ correspond to actions even though they have public visibility.
====



== Entities vs View Models

When developing an Apache Isis application you will most likely start off with the persistent domain entities:
`Customer`, `Order`, `Product`, and so on.  For some applications this may well suffice.  However, if the application
needs to integrate with other systems, or if the application needs to support reasonably complex business processes,
then you may need to look beyond just domain entities.

To support these use cases we support view models.  In the same way that an (RDBMS) database view can aggregate and
abstract from multiple underlying database tables, so a view model sits on top of one or many underlying entities.

View models are not persisted, but nevertheless they can have behaviour (and titles, and icons) just like domain
entities.  Indeed, to a user of the system there is no particular distinction (again, in the same way that when using
an RDBMS one can use database views and database tables pretty much interchangeably).

View models generally tend to be associated with supporting a particular use case; logically they are part of the
application layer, not part of the domain layer (where entities live).

We introduce view models here because they do get mentioned quite often within the users and reference guide.  However,
we do consider them a more advanced topic; we generally recommend that you build your applications from the domain
layer up, rather than from the view model down.

For further discussion on view models, see xref:ugbtb.adoc#_ugbtb_view-models[this topic].




[[_ugfun_core-concepts_building-blocks_domain-services]]
== Domain Services

Domain services consist of a set of logically grouped actions, and as such follow the same conventions as for entities. However, a service cannot have (persisted) properties, nor can it have (persisted) collections.

Domain services are instantiated once and once only by the framework, and are used to centralize any domain logic that does not logically belong in a domain entity or value. Apache Isis will automatically inject services into every domain entity that requests them, and into each other.

For convenience you can inherit from AbstractService or one of its subclasses, but this is not mandatory.


=== Domain Services vs View Services

NOTE: TODO

`@DomainService(nature=...)`

.Factories, Repositories and Services
****
A distinction is sometimes made between a factory (that creates object) and a repository (that is used to find existing objects).  You will find them discussed separately in Evans' link:http://books.google.com/books/about/Domain_Driven_Design.html?id=hHBf4YxMnWMC[Domain Driven Design], for example.

In Apache Isis these are all implemented as domain services.  Indeed, it is quite common to have a domain service that acts as both a factory and a repository.

[[_ugfun_core-concepts_building-blocks_oid]]
== OIDs

As well as defining a xref:ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_core-concepts_building-blocks_metamodel[metamodel] of the structure (domain
classes) of its domain objects, Apache Isis also manages the runtime instances of said domain objects.

When a domain entity is recreated from the database, the framework keeps track of its identity through an "OID": an
object identifier.  Fundamentally this is a combination of its type (domain class), along with an identifier.  You can think
of it as its "primary key", except across all domain entity types.

For portability and resilience, though, the object type is generally an alias for the actual domain class: thus
"customers.CUS", say, rather than "com.mycompany.myapp.customers.Customer".  This is derived from an annotation.  The
identifier meanwhile is always converted to a string.

Although simple, the OID is an enormously powerful concept: it represents a URI to any domain object managed by
a given Apache Isis application.  With it, we have the ability to lookup any arbitrary domain objects.

Some examples:

* an OID allows sharing of information between users, eg as a deep link to be pasted into an email.

* the information within an OID could be converted into a barcode, and stamped onto a PDF form.  When the PDF is
scanned by the mail room, the barcode could be read to attach the correspondence to the relevant domain object.

* as a handle to any object in an audit record, as used by xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_AuditerService[`AuditerService`] or xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_AuditingService[`AuditingService`] (the latter deprecated);

* similarly within implementations of xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_CommandService[`CommandService`] to persist `Command`
objects

* similarly within implementations of xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_PublisherService[`PublisherService`]
to persist published action invocations

* and of course both the xref:ugvro.adoc#[RestfulObjects viewer] and
xref:ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer]
use the oid tuple to look up, render and allow the user to interact with domain objects.

Although the exact content of an OID should be considered opaque by domain objects, it is possible for domain objects
to obtain OIDs.  These are represented as `Bookmark`s, obtained from the
xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_BookmarkService[`BookmarkService`].  Deep links meanwhile can be obtained from
the xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-DeepLinkService[`@DeepLinkService`].

OIDs can also be converted into XML format, useful for integration scenarios.  The
xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_schema-common[common schema] XSD defines the `oidDto` complex type for precisely this purpose.
