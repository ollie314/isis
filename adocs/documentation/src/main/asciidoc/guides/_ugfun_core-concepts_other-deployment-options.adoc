Apache Isis is a mature platform suitable for production deployment, with its "sweet spot" being line-of-business enterprise applications.  So if you're looking to develop that sort of application, we certainly hope you'll seriously evaluate it.

But there are other ways that you can make Apache Isis work for you; in this chapter we explore a few of them.



== Deploy to production

Let's start though with the default use case for Apache Isis: building line-of-business enterprise applications, on top of its Wicket viewer.

Apache Wicket, and therefore Apache Isis in this configuration, is a stateful architecture.  As a platform it is certainly capable of supporting user bases of several thousand (with perhaps one or two hundred concurrent); however it isn't an architecture that you should try to scale up to tens of thousands of concurrent users.

The UI UI generated by the Wicket viewer is well suited to many line-of-business apps, but it's also worth knowing that (with a little knowledge of the Wicket APIs) it relatively straightforward to extend.  As described in xref:ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_core-concepts_add-ons[Isis addons] chapter, the viewer already has integrations with https://github.com/isisaddons/isis-wicket-gmap3[google maps], https://github.com/isisaddons/isis-wicket-fullcalendar2[a full calendar] and an https://github.com/isisaddons/isis-wicket-excel[export to Excel] component.  We are also aware of integrations with SVG images (for floor maps of shopping center) and of custom widgets displaying a catalogue (text and images) of medical diseases.

Deploying on Apache Isis means that the framework also manages object persistence.  For many line-of-business applications this will mean using a relational database.  It is also possible (courtesy of its integratinon with link:http://www.datanucleus.org[DataNucleus]) to deploy an Isis app to a NoSQL store such as Neo4J or MongoDB; and it is also possible to deploy to cloud platforms such as link:https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs[Google App Engine (GAE)].



== Use for prototyping

Even if you don't intend to deploy your application on top of Apache Isis, there can be a lot of value in using Apache Isis for prototyping.  Because all you need do to get an app running is write domain objects, you can very quickly explore a domain object model and validate ideas with a domain expert.

By focusing just on the domain, you'll also find that you start to develop a ubiquitous language - a set of terms and concepts that the entire team (business and technologists alike) have a shared understanding.

Once you've sketched out your domain model, you can then "start-over" using your preferred platform.





== Deploy on your own platform

The programming model defined by Apache Isis deliberately minimizes the dependencies on the rest of the framework. In fact, the only hard dependency that the domain model classes have on Apache Isis is through the `org.apache.isis.applib` classes, mostly to pick up annotations such as `@Disabled`.
So, if you have used Apache Isis for prototyping (discussed above), then note that it's quite feasible to take your domain model a the basis of your actual development effort; Apache Isis' annotations and programming conventions will help ensure that any subtle semantics you might have captured in your prototyping are not lost.

If you go this route, your deployment platform will of course need to provide similar capabilities to Apache Isis.  In particular, you'll need to figure out a way to inject domain services into domain entities (eg using a JPA listener), and you'll also need to reimplement any domain services you have used that Apache Isis provides "out-of-the-box" (eg xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_QueryResultsCache[`QueryResultsCache`] domain service).





== Deploy the REST API

REST (Representation State Transfer) is an architectural style for building highly scalable distributed systems, using the same principles as the World Wide Web. Many commercial web APIs (twitter, facebook, Amazon) are implemented as either pure REST APIs or some approximation therein.

The http://restfulobjects.org[Restful Objects specification] defines a means by a domain object model can be exposed as RESTful resources using JSON representations over HTTP. Apache Isis' xref:ugvro.adoc#[RestfulObjects viewer] is an implementation of that spec, making any Apache Isis domain object automatically available via REST.

There are a number of use cases for deploying Isis as a REST API, including:

* to allow a custom UI to be built against the RESTful API +
+
For example, using AngularJS or some other RIA technology such as Flex, JavaFX, Silverlight

* to enable integration between systems +
+
REST is designed to be machine-readable, and so is an excellent choice for synchronous data interchange scenarios.

* as a ready-made API for migrating data from one legacy system to its replacement.


As for the auto-generated webapps, the framework manages object persistence. It is perfectly possible to deploy the REST API alongside an auto-generated webapp; both work from the same domain object model.





== Implement your own viewer

Isis' architecture was always designed to support multiple viewers; and indeed Apache Isis out-of-the-box supports two: the Wicket viewer, and the Restful Objects viewer (or three, if one includes the Wrapper Factory).

While we mustn't understate the effort involved here, it is feasible to implement your own viewers too.  Indeed, one of Apache Isis' committers does indeed have a (closed source) viewer, based on http://www.wavemaker.com/[Wavemaker].
