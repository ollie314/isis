Apache Isis implements the naked objects pattern, originally formulated by Richard Pawson.  So who better than Richard to explain the origination of the idea?

pass:[<div class="extended-quote-first"><p>]The Naked Objects pattern arose, at least in part, from my own frustration at the lack of success of the domain-driven approach. Good examples were hard to find--as they are still.

pass:[<div class="extended-quote"><p>]A common complaint from _DDD_ practitioners was that it was hard to gain enough commitment from business stakeholders, or even to engage them at all. My own experience suggested that it was nearly impossible to engage business managers with UML diagrams.  It was much easier to engage them in rapid prototyping -- where they could see and interact with the results -- but most forms of rapid prototyping concentrate on the presentation layer, often at the expense of the underlying model and certainly at the expense of abstract thinking.
pass:[</p></div>]

pass:[<div class="extended-quote"><p>]Even if you could engage the business sponsors sufficiently to design a domain model, by the time you'd finished developing the system on top of the domain model, most of its benefits had disappeared. It's all very well creating an agile domain object model, but if any change to that model also dictates the modification of one or more layers underneath it (dealing with persistence) and multiple layers on top (dealing with presentation), then that agility is practically worthless.
pass:[</p></div>]

pass:[<div class="extended-quote"><p>]The other concern that gave rise to the birth of Naked Objects was how to make user interfaces of mainstream business systems more "expressive" -- how to make them feel more like using a drawing program or _CAD_ system. Most business systems are not at all expressive; they treat the user merely as a dumb *process-follower*, rather than as an empowered *problem-solver*.  Even the so-called usability experts had little to say on the subject: try finding the word "empowerment" or any synonym thereof in the index of any book on usability. Research had demonstrated that the best way to achieve expressiveness was to create an object-oriented user interface (_OOUI_). In practice, though, __OOUI__s were notoriously hard to develop.
pass:[</p></div>]

pass:[<div class="extended-quote"><p>]Sometime in the late 1990s, it dawned on me that if the domain model really did represent the "ubiquitous language" of the business and those domain objects were behaviorally rich (that is, business logic is encapsulated as methods on the domain objects rather than in procedural scripts on top of them), then the _UI_ could be nothing more than a reflection of the user interface. This would solve both of my concerns. It would make it easier to do domain-driven design, because one could instantly translate evolving domain modeling ideas into a working prototype. And it would deliver an expressive, object-oriented user interface for free. Thus was born the idea of Naked Objects.

You can learn much more about the pattern in the book, link:http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0470844205/[Naked Objects], also freely available to link:http://www.nakedobjects.org/book/[read online].  Richard co-wrote the book with one of Apache Isis' committers, Robert Matthews, who was in turn the author of the Naked Objects Framework for Java (the original codebase of of Apache Isis).

[TIP]
====
One of the external examiners for Richard's PhD was link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trygve_Reenskaug[Trygve Reenskaug], who originally formulated the MVC pattern at Xeroc PARC.  In his paper, link:http://heim.ifi.uio.no/~trygver/2007/2007.02.13-babyUML.pdf[Baby UML], Reenskaug describes that when implemented the first MVC, "the conventional wisdom in the group was that objects should be visible and tangible, thus bridging the gap between the human brain and the abstract data within the computer."  Sound familiar?  It's interesting to speculate what might have been if this idea had been implemented back then in the late 70s.

Reenskaug then goes on to say that "this simple and powerful idea failed because ... users were used to seeing [objects] from different perspectives. The visible and tangible object would get very complex if it should be able to show itself and be manipulated in many different ways."

In Apache Isis the responsibility of rendering an object is not the object itself, it is the framework.  Rather, the object inspects the object and uses that to decide how to render the object.  This is also extensible.  In the link:http://www.isisaddons.org[Isis Addons] (non-ASF) the http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-wicket-gmap3[Isis addons' gmap3] wicket extension renders any object with latitude/longitude on a map, while http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-wicket-fullcalendar2[Isis addons' fullcalendar2 wicket extension] renders any object with date(s) on a calendar.

This screencast shows Apache Isis v1.0.0, Jan 2013.  The UI has been substantially refined since that release.
