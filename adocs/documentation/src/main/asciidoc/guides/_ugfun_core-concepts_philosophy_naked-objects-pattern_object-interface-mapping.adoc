Another -- more technical -- way to think about the naked objects pattern is as an _object interface mapper_, or `OIM`.  We sometimes use this idea to explain naked objects to a bunch of developers.

Just as an ORM (such as link:http://datanucleus.org[DataNucleus] or link:http://hibernate.org[Hibernate]) maps domain entities to a database, you can think of the naked objects pattern as representing the concept of mapping domain objects to a user interface.

This is the way that the link:http://metawidget.org/[MetaWidget] team, in particular Richard Kennard, the primary contributor, likes to describe their tool.  MetaWidget has a number of ideas in common with Apache Isis, specifically the runtime generation of a UI for domain objects.  You can hear more from Kennard and others on this http://devchat.tv/js-jabber/150-jsj-oims[Javascript Jabber podcast].
