The link:_ugfun_core-concepts_principles_apache-isis-vs_cqrs[CQRS architecture], discussed above, is often combined with _Event Sourcing_ pattern, though they are separate ideas.

With event sourcing, each business operation emits a domain event (or possibly events) that allow other objects in the system to act accordingly.  For example, if a customer places an order then this might emit the `OrderPlacedEvent`.  Most significantly, the subscribers to these events can include the datastore itself; the state of the system is in effect a transaction log of every event that has occurred since "the beginning of time": it is sometimes called an event store.   With CQRS, this event datastore corresponds to the command/write datastore (the query/read datastore is of course derived from the command datastore).

Although it might seem counter-intuitive to be able store persistent state in this way (as a souped up "transaction log"), the reality is that with modern compute capabilities make it quite feasible to replay many 10s/100s of thousands of events in a second.  And the architecture supports some interesting use cases; for example it becomes quite trivial to rewind the system back to some previous point in time.

When combined with CQRS we see a command that triggers a business operation, and an event that results from it.  So, a `PlaceOrderCommand` command can result in an `OrderPlacedEvent` event.  A subscriber to this event might then generate a further command to act upon some other system (eg to dispatch the system).  Note that the event might be dispatched and consumed in-process or alternatively this might occur out-of-process.  If the latter, then the subscriber will operate within a separate transaction, meaning the usual eventual consistency concerns and also compensating actions if a rollback is required.  CQRS/event sourcing advocates point out - correctly  that this is just how things are in the "real world" too.

In Apache Isis every business action (and indeed, property and collection) emits domain events through the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_EventBusService[`EventBusService`] , and can optionally also be published through the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_PublishingService[`PublishingService`].  The former are dispatched and consumed in-process and within the same transaction, and for this reason the xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_super_AbstractSubscriber[subscribers] can also veto the events.  The latter are intended for out-of-process consumption; the (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-publishing[Isis addons' publishing] and http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-publishmq[Isis addons' publishmq] modules provide implementations for dispatching either through a RDBMS database table, or directly through to an link:http://camel.apache.org[ActiveMQ] message queue (eg wired up to link:http://camel.apache.org[Apache Camel] event bus).
