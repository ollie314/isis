This section discusses some of the principles and values we apply to the development of the Apache Isis framework itself.

== Full-stack but Extensible

NOTE: TODO


== Focuses on its USP

NOTE: TODO


add-ons

* Apache Isis is at heart a metamodel with runtime, and coordinates interations using an AOP set of principles
* Apache Isis vs Isis Addons
* Apache Isis vs Shiro vs DataNucleus



... all code has legacy in it.... parts of the Isis codebase are well over a decade old; and back then a lot of the JEE technologies that we'd like to be using just didn't exist, so we had to invent the features we required ourselves.

... also, Apache Isis today is more pragmatic than previously
* a client/server solution, with AWT-based client
* a HTML browser, Scimpi (JSF-like, but not using JSF), ...
* security
* objectstores

We're working hard to remove duplication, reuse existing open source/JEE, and simplify.


The areas of Apache Isis we consider mature are those that have been developed in support of real-world applications implemented by the committers.  Foremost among these is Estatio.


Focus on enterprise / line-of-business applications, for use by internal staff.

* problem solvers, not process followers

* view models
