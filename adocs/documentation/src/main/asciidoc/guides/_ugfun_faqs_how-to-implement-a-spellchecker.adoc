From this link:http://isis.markmail.org/thread/dduarjscrbnodfsi[thread] on the Apache Isis users mailing list:

* _What is the easiest way to add a spell checker to the text written in a field in
   a domain object, for instance to check English syntax?_

One way to implement is to use the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_EventBusService[event bus]:

* Set up a xref:rgcsm.adoc#_rgcsm_classes_domainevent[domain event] xref:rgcsm.adoc#_rgcsm_classes_super_AbstractSubscriber[subscriber] that can veto the changes.

* if the change is made through an action, you can use xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Action_domainEvent[`@Action#domainEvent()`].

if if the change is made through an edit, you can use xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Property_domainEvent[`@Property#domainEvent()`].

You'll need some way to know which fields should be spell checked.  Two ways spring to mind:

* either look at the domain event's identifier

* or subclass the domain event (recommended anyway) and have those subclass events implement some sort of marker
interface, eg a `SpellCheckEvent`.

And you'll (obviously) also need some sort of spell checker implementation to call.
