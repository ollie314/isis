From link:http://isis.markmail.org/thread/ctppmtcbsf4iskzi[this thread] on the Apache Isis users mailing list:

* _I am trying to internationalize the label descriptions of form actions, eg those in `ActionParametersFormPanel`.  Referencing those via their message id inside a .po file didn't work either.  Can this be done?_


The above FAQ was raised against `1.10.0`.  As of `1.11.0` (due to link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ISIS-1093[ISIS-1093]) it _is_ now possible to internationalize both the Wicket viewer's labels as well as the regular translations of the domain object metadata using the `.po` translation files as
supported by the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_TranslationService[`TranslationService`].

Full details of the ``msgId``s that must be added to the `translations.po` file can be found in xref:guides/ugbtb.adoc#_ugbtb_i18n_wicket-viewer[i18n] section of the xref:ugbtb.adoc#[beyond the basics] guide.

In prior releases (`1.10.0` and earlier) it was necessary to use link:https://ci.apache.org/projects/wicket/guide/6.x/guide/i18n.html#i18n_3[ Wicket's internationalization support], namely resource bundles.  This is still supported (as a fallback):

* create a directory structure inside the webapp resource folder following that pattern `org.apache.isis.viewer.wicket.ui.components.actions`
* Inside there create an equivalent `ActionParametersFormPanel_xx_XX.properties` or `ActionParametersFormPanel_xx.properties` file for the various locales that you want to support (eg `ActionParametersFormPanel_en_UK.properties`, `ActionParametersFormPanel_en_US.properties`, `ActionParametersFormPanel_de.properties` and so on).
