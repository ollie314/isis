From this link:http://markmail.org/message/4kcu7sml4ufdsah3[thread] on the Apache Isis users mailing list:

* _I am trying to display an image in a JavaScript client app, the image comes from
   an Isis RO web service as a string, but it won't show.  Is there something I should do to change the message?_

The RO viewer returns the image as a string, in the form:

    "Tacos.jpg:image/jpeg:/9j//4AAQSkZJRgABAQEAlgCWAAD/  ...."

This is in the form:

    (filename):(mime type):(binary data in base64)

This is basically the xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_value-types_Blob[`Blob`] value type, in string form.

To use, split the parts then format the mime type and base64 data correctly before using as source in an `<img>` tag.
