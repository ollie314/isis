If it seems that Apache Isis (or rather DataNucleus) isn't fully populating domain entities (ie leaving some properties
as `null`), then check that your actions are not accessing the fields directly.  Use getters instead.  that is:

[WARNING]
====
Properties of domain entities should always be accessed using getters.  The only code that should access to fields
should be the getters themselves.
====

Why so? Because DataNucleus will potentially lazy load some properties, but to do this it needs to know that the
field is being requested.  This is the purpose of the enhancement phase: the bytecode of the original getter method is
actually wrapped in code that does the lazy loading checking.  But hitting the field directly means that the lazy
loading code does not run.

This error can be subtle: sometimes "incorrect" code that accesses the fields will seem to work.  But that will be
because the field has been populated already, for whatever reason.

One case where you will find the issue highlighted is for subtype tables that have been mapped using an inheritance
strategy of `NEW_TABLE`, eg:

[source,java]
----
@javax.jdo.annotations.PersistenceCapable
@javax.jdo.annotations.Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceStrategy.NEW_TABLE)
public class SupertypeEntity {
    ...
}
----

and then:

[source,java]
----
@javax.jdo.annotations.PersistenceCapable
@javax.jdo.annotations.Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceStrategy.NEW_TABLE)
public class SubtypeEntity extends SupertypeEntity {
    ...
}
----

This will generate two tables in the database, with the primary key of the supertype table propagated as a foreign key
(also primary key) of the subtype table (sometimes called "table per type" strategy).  This means that DataNucleus
might retrieve data from only the supertype table, and the lazily load the subtype fields only as required.  This is
preferable to doing a left outer join from the super- to the subtype tables to retrieve data that might not be needed.

On the other hand, if the `SUPERCLASS_TABLE` strategy (aka "table per hierarchy" or roll-up) or the `SUBCLASS_TABLE`
strategy (roll-down) was used, then the problem is less likely to occur because DataNucleus would obtain all the data
for any given instance from a single table.

Final note: references to other objects (either scalar references or in collections) in particular require that getters
rather than fields to be used to obtain them: it's hopefully obvious that DataNucleus (like all ORMs) should not and
will not resolve such references (otherwise, where to stop... and the whole database would be loaded into memory).

In summary, there's just one rule: *always use the getters, never the fields*.
