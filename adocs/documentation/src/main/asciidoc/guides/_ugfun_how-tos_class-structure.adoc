Apache Isis works by building a metamodel of the domain objects: entities, xref:ugbtb.adoc#_ugbtb_view-models[view model]s and services.  The class members of both entities and view models represent both state -- (single-valued) properties and (multi-valued) collections -- and behaviour -- actions.  The class members of domain services is simpler: just behaviour, ie actions.

In the automatically generated UI a property is rendered as a field.  This can be either of a value type (a string, number, date, boolean etc) or can be a reference to another entity.  A collection is generally rendered as a table.

In order for Apache Isis to build its metamodel the domain objects must follow some conventions: what we call the _Apache Isis Programming Model_.  This is just an extension of the pojo / JavaBean standard of yesteryear: properties and collections are getters/setters, while actions are simply any remaining `public` methods.

Additional metamodel semantics are inferred both imperatively from _supporting methods_ and declaratively from annotations.

In this section we discuss the mechanics of writing domain objects that comply with Apache Isis' programming model.

[TIP]
====
In fact, the Apache Isis programming model is extensible; you can teach Apache Isis new programming conventions and you can remove existing ones; ultimately they amount to syntax.   The only real fundamental that can't be changed is the notion that objects consist of properties, collections and actions.

You can learn more about extending Apache Isis programming model xref:ugbtb.adoc#_ugbtb_programming-model[here].
