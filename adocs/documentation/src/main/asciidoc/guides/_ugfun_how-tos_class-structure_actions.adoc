NOTE: TODO


[NOTE]
====
While Apache Isis support actions whose parameters' types are scalar (values such as `String`, `int`, or references such as `Customer`), the framework (currently) does not support parameter types that are collections or maps.

The workaround is to mark the collection as `@Programmatic`, as described in xref:ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_how-tos_class-structure_ignoring-methods[Ignoring Methods].  This ensures that the collection is ignored by Apache Isis.
