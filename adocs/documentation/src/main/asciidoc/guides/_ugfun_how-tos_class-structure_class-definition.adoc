NOTE: TODO


Classes are defined both to Isis and (if an entity) also to JDO/DataNucleus.


We use Java packages as a way to group related domain objects together; the package name forms a namespace. We can then reason about all the classes in that package/namespace as a single unit.

In the same way that Java packages act as a namespace for domain objects, it's good practice to map domain entities to their own (database) schemas.
