Apache Isis autowires (automatically injects) domain services into each entity, as well as into the domain services themselves, using either method injection or field injection. The applib `DomainObjectContainer` is also a service, so can be injected in exactly the same manner.


[NOTE]
====
Isis currently does _not_ support qualified injection of services; the domain service of each type must be distinct from any other.

If you find a requirement to inject two instances of type `SomeService`, say, then the work-around is to create trivial subclasses `SomeServiceA` and `SomeServiceB` and inject these instead.
====


== Field Injection

Field injection is recommended, using the `@javax.inject.Inject` annotation. For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    @javax.inject.Inject
    OrderRepository orderRepository;
    ...
}
----


We recommend using default rather than `private` visibility so that the field can be mocked out within unit tests (placed in the same package as the code under test).




== Method Injection

Isis also supports two forms of method injection.  All that is required to inject a service into a entity/service is to provide an appropriate method or field. The name
of the method does not matter, only that it is prefixed either `set` or `inject`, is
public, and has a single parameter of the correct type.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    private OrderRepository orderRepository;
    public void setOrderRepository(OrderRepository orderRepository) {
        this.orderRepository = orderRepository;
    }
    ...
}
----

or alternatively, using 'inject' as the prefix:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    private OrderRepository orderRepository;
    public void injectOrderRepository(OrderRepository orderRepository) {
        this.orderRepository = orderRepository;
    }
    ...
}
----

Note that the method name can be anything; it doesn't need to be related to the type being injected.




== Constructor injection

Simply to note that constructor injection is _not_ supported by Apache Isis (and is unlikely to be, because the JDO specification for entities requires a no-arg constructor).
