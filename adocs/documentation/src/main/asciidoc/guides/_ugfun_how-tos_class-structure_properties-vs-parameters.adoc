NOTE: TODO


In many cases the value types of properties and of action parameters align. For example, a `Customer` entity might have a `surname` property, and there might also be corresponding `changeSurname`.  Ideally we want the surname property and surname action parameter to use the same value type.

Having first-class support for this is a goal of Apache Isis, and it is already possible (by writing some plumbing and glue code using Isis and DataNucleus APIs) to get some way towards this ideal.  However, in the vast majority of cases it is much easier and more practical to simply use standard value types such as `java.lang.String`.

However, the JDO/DataNucleus annotations for specifying semantics such as optionality or maximum length are restricted to only apply to fields and to methods; they cannot be applied to action parameters.  It is therefore necessary to use Apache Isis' equivalent annotations for action parameters.

The table below summarises the equivalence of some of the most common cases.
