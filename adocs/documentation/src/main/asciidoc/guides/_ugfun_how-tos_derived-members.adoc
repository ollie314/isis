== Derived Property

NOTE: TODO




== Derived Collection

NOTE: TODO

While derived properties and derived collections typically "walk the graph" to associated objects, there is nothing to prevent the returned value being the result of invoking a repository (domain service) action.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    ...
    public List<Order> getMostRecentOrders() {
        return orderRepo.findMostRecentOrders(this, 5);
    }
}
----




== Trigger on property change

NOTE: TODO - xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_methods_prefixes_modify[`modify...()`], xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_methods_prefixes_clear[`clear...()`]



== Trigger on collection change

NOTE: TODO - xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_methods_prefixes_addTo[`addTo...()`], xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_methods_prefixes_removeFrom[`removeFrom...()`]
