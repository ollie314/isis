Although in Apache Isis you can have properties of either values (string, number, date etc) or of (references to other) entities, with collections the framework (currently) only supports collections of (references to) entities.  That is, collections of values (a bag of numbers, say) are not supported.

However, it is possible to simulate a bag of numbers using view models.


== View Model

NOTE: TODO



== Persistence Concerns

NOTE: TODO -  easiest to simply store using DataNucleus' support for collections, marked as xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Programmatic[`@Programmatic`] so that it is ignored by Apache Isis.  Alternatively can store as json/xml in a varchar(4000) or clob and manually unpack.
