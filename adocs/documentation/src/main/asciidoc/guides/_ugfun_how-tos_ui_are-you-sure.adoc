Sometimes an action might perform irreversible changes.  In such a case it's probably a good idea for the UI to require that the
end-user explicitly confirms that they intended to invoke the action.

== Using action semantics

One way to meet this requirement is using the framework's built-in xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Action_semantics[`@Action#semantics()`] attribute:

[source,java]
----
@Action(
        semantics = SemanticsOf.IDEMPOTENT_ARE_YOU_SURE
)
public SimpleObject updateName(
        @Parameter(maxLength = NAME_LENGTH)
        @ParameterLayout(named = "New name")
        final String name) {
    setName(name);
    return this;
}
----


This will render as:

image::{_imagesdir}/how-tos/tips-n-tricks/action-semantics-are-you-sure.png[]


== Using a checkbox

An alternative approach (for all versions of the framework) is to require the end-user to check a dummy checkbox parameter (and prevent the action from being invoked if the user hasn't checked that parameter).

For example:

image::{_imagesdir}/how-tos/tips-n-tricks/are-you-sure.png[]

[NOTE]
====
Note that these screenshots shows an earlier version of the xref:ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] UI (specifically, pre 1.8.0).
====

If the user checks the box:

image::{_imagesdir}/how-tos/tips-n-tricks/are-you-sure-happy-case.png[]

then the action will complete.

However, if the user fails to check the box, then a validation message is shown:

image::{_imagesdir}/how-tos/tips-n-tricks/are-you-sure-sad-case.png[]



The code for this is pretty simple:

[source,java]
----
public List<ToDoItem> delete(@Named("Are you sure?") boolean areYouSure) {
    container.removeIfNotAlready(this);
    container.informUser("Deleted " + container.titleOf(this));
    return toDoItems.notYetComplete();          // <1>
}
public String validateDelete(boolean areYouSure) {
    return areYouSure? null: "Please confirm you are sure";
}
----
<1> invalid to return `this` (cannot render a deleted object)

Note that the action itself does not use the boolean parameter, it is only
used by the supporting xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_methods_prefixes_validate[`validate...()`] method.
