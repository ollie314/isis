In implementing the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_objects[naked objects pattern], Apache Isis aims to infer as much information from the domain classes as possible.  Nevertheless, some metadata relating solely to the UI is inevitably required.


This chapter describes how this is done both for domain objects -- statically or dynamically -- and for the application menu bar (containing domain service' actions).
