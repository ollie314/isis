Metadata providing UI hints can be specified either xref:ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_object-layout_static[statically], using annotations, or dynamically, using either a xref:ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_object-layout_dynamic_xml[``layout.xml``] file or (as described here) a `.layout.json` file.


[IMPORTANT]
====
The use of dynamic layouts through the `.layout.json` is DEPRECATED.  Instead, use the
``.layout.xml`` file, which enables much more sophisticated custom layouts than those provided by ``.layout.json``.

It is possible to download initial `.layout.xml` files - which will capture all the metadata originally in the `.layout.json` file - using the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_LayoutService[`LayoutService`] (exposed as an action on the prototyping menu).
The `.layout.json` file will be ignored once a `.layout.xml` file is present.
====

== JSON layout file

The JSON layout file for class `Xxx` takes the name `Xxx.layout.json`, and resides in the same package as the class.


The format of the file is:

  "columns": [                                // list of columns

----

Although advisable, it is not necessary to list all class members in this file. Any members not listed with be
ordered according either to annotations (if present) or fallback/default values.

Note also that the layout file may contain entries for xref:ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_how-tos_contributed-members[contributed associations and actions]; this allows each contributee classes to define their own layout for their contributions, possibly overriding any static metadata on the original domain service contributor.



== Downloading an initial layout

The fastest way to get started is to use the (non-ASF) link:http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-devutils[Isis addons' devutils] module to download the layout file (derived from any existing static metadata defined by annotations).



== Required updates to the dom project's pom.xml

Any `.layout.json` files must be compiled and available in the classpath.  Ensure the following is defined in the dom project's `pom.xml`:

[source.xml]
----
<resources>
    <resource>
        <filtering>false</filtering>
        <directory>src/main/resources</directory>
    </resource>
    <resource>
        <filtering>false</filtering>
        <directory>src/main/java</directory>
        <includes>
            <include>**</include>
        </includes>
        <excludes>
            <exclude>**/*.java</exclude>
        </excludes>
    </resource>
</resources>

If using an Apache Isis xref:ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_getting-started_simpleapp-archetype[SimpleApp archetype], then the POM is already correctly configured.
