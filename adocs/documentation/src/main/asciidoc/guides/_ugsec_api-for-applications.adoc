Generally speaking your domain objects (or more generally your application) should be agnostic of the user/roles that are interacting with them; applying security permissions is the responsibility of the framework.

Still, on very rare occasion you may have a need, in which case you can either use Apache Isis' `DomainObjectContainer` API or you can reach further down the stack and use the JEE Servlet API.


== `DomainObjectContainer` API

The xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_DomainObjectContainer[`DomainObjectContainer`] service exposes the following API:

[source,java]
----
final UserMemento user = container.getUser();
final List<RoleMemento> roles = user.getRoles();
for (RoleMemento role : roles) {
    String roleName = role.getName();
    ...
}
----

Each role's `name` property encodes both the realm that provided the role, and the role identity itself.

For example, in the simpleapp, if logging in as `dick` with the following entries for `realm1`:

[source,ini]
----
dick = pass, user_role, analysis_role, self-install_role
----

then this corresponds to the roles "realm1:user_role", "realm1:self-install_role" and "realm1:analysis_role".

If using the Wicket viewer, then note there will also be another role which is used internally (namely "org.apache.isis.viewer.wicket.roles.USER").





== Servlet API

On occasion you may find it necessary to reach below Isis and to the underlying servlet API.  For example, the http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-togglz[Isis addons' togglz] module (non-ASF) has a requirement to do this in order to expose its embedded togglz web console.  (

[TIP]
====
If you do need to access the servlet API and are running within the context of Wicket viewer, the http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-servletapi[Isis addons' servletapi] module can provide access to the `HttpServletRequest`, `HttpServletResponse` and `ServletContext`.
====

In this situation, you can still obtain some information about the user and its roles:

[source,java]
----
Principal principal = httpServletRequest.getPrincipal();
String username = principal.getName();
boolean analyst = httpServletRequest.isUserInRole("analysis_role");
----

However, it isn't possible to obtain any role permissions for the user.
