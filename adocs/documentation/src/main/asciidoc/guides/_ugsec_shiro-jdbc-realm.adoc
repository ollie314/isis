There is nothing to stop you from using some other `Realm` implementation (or indeed writing one yourself).  For example, you could use Shiro's own JDBC realm that loads user/password details from a database.

[WARNING]
====
If you are happy to use a database then we strongly recommend you use the http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-security[Isis addons' security] module instead of a vanilla JDBC; it is far more sophisticated and moreover gives you the ability to administer the system from within your Isis application.

If you go down this route, then the architecture is as follows:

There's quite a lot of configuration required (in `WEB-INF/shiro.ini`) to set up a JDBC realm, so we'll break it out into sections.

First, we need to set up the connection to JDBC:

[source,ini]
----
jdbcRealm=org.apache.shiro.realm.jdbc.JdbcRealm        # <1>

jof = org.apache.shiro.jndi.JndiObjectFactory          # <2>
jof.resourceName = jdbc/postgres                       # <3>
jof.requiredType = javax.sql.DataSource
jof.resourceRef = true

jdbcRealm.dataSource = $jof                            # <4>
----
<1> instantiate the JDBC realm
<2> instantiate factory object to lookup DataSource from servlet container
<3> name of the datasource (as configured in `web.xml`)
<4> instruct JDBC realm to obtain datasource from the JNDI


We next need to tell the realm how to query the database.  Shiro supports any schema; what matters is the input search argument and the output results.

[source,ini]
----

jdbcRealm.authenticationQuery =         \              # <1>
        select password                 \
          from users                    \
         where username = ?

jdbcRealm.userRolesQuery =              \              # <2>
        select r.label                  \
          from users_roles ur           \
    inner join roles r                  \
            on ur.role_id = r.id        \
         where user_id = (              \
            select id                   \
             from users                 \
            where username = ?);        \

jdbcRealm.permissionsQuery=             \               # <3>
        select p.permission             \
          from roles_permissions rp     \
    inner join permissions p            \
            on rp.permission_id = p.id  \
         where rp.role_id = (           \
            select id                   \
             from roles                 \
            where label = ?);

jdbcRealm.permissionsLookupEnabled=true                 # <4>
----
<1> query to find password for user
<2> query to find roles for user
<3> query to find permissions for role
<4> enable permissions lookup

[WARNING]
====
The `permissionsLookupEnabled` is very important, otherwise Shiro just returns an empty list of permissions and your users will have no access to any features(!).
====

We also should ensure that the passwords are not stored as plain-text:

[source,ini]
----
dps = org.apache.shiro.authc.credential.DefaultPasswordService   # <1>
pm = org.apache.shiro.authc.credential.PasswordMatcher           # <2>
pm.passwordService = $dps
jdbcRealm.credentialsMatcher = $pm                               # <3>
----
<1> mechanism to encrypts password
<2> service to match passwords
<3> instruct JDBC realm to use password matching service when authenticating


And finally we need to tell Shiro to use the realm, in the usual fashion:

[source,ini]
----
securityManager.realms = $jdbcRealm
----

Using the above configuration you will also need to setup a `DataSource`.  The details vary by servlet container, for example this is link:https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/jndi-datasource-examples-howto.html[how to do the setup on Tomcat 8.0].

[WARNING]
====
The name of the `DataSource` can also vary by servlet container; see for example link:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17441019/how-to-configure-jdbcrealm-to-obtain-its-datasource-from-jndi/23784702#23784702[this StackOverflow answer].
