link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development[Behaviour-driven design] (BDD) redefines testing not as an after-the-fact "let's check the system works", but rather as a means to work with the domain expert to (a) specify the behaviour of the feature _before_ starting implementation, and (b) provide a means that the domain expert can verify the feature after it has been implemented.

Since domain experts are usually non-technical (at least, they are unlikely to be able to read or want to learn how to read JUnit/Java code), then applying BDD typically requires writing specifications in using structured English text and (ASCII) tables.  The BDD tooling parses this text and uses it to actually interact with the system under test.  As a byproduct the BDD frameworks generate readable output of some form; this is often an annotated version of the original specification, marked up to indicate which specifications passed, which have failed.  This readable output is a form of "living documentation"; it captures the actual behaviour of the system, and so is guaranteed to be accurate.

There are many BDD tools out there; Apache Isis provides an integration with link:https://cucumber.io/docs/reference/jvm#java[Cucumber JVM] (see also the https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm[github site]):
