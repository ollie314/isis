To help write feature files and generate step definitions, we recommend https://github.com/rlogiacco/Natural[Roberto Lo Giacco's Eclipse plugin]. For more information, see Dan's short http://danhaywood.com/2013/07/05/cucumber-editors-in-eclipse/[blog post]. It works very well. Of interest: this is implemented using http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/[XText].
