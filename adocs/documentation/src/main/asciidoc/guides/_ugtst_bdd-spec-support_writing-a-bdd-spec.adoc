BDD specifications contain:

* a `XxxSpec.feature` file, describing the feature and the scenarios (given/when/then)s that constitute its acceptance criteria

* a `RunSpecs.java` class file to run the specification (all boilerplate). This will run all `.feature` files in the same package or subpackages.

* one or several `XxxGlue` constituting the step definitions to be matched against. +
+
The "glue" (step definitions) are intended to be reused across features. We therefore recommend that they reside in a separate package, and are organized by the entity type upon which they act. +
+
For example, given a feature that involves `Customer` and `Order`, have the step definitions pertaining to `Customer` reside in `CustomerGlue`, and the step definitions pertaining to `Order` reside in `OrderGlue`. +
+
The `glue` attribute of the Cucumber-JVM JUnit runner eallows you to indicate which package(s) should be recursively searched to find any glue.

* a system initializer class.  You can reuse the  system initializer from any integration tests (as described in xref:ugtst.adoc#_ugtst_integ-test-support[Integration Test Support], bootstrapping section).


Here's an example of a feature from the xref:ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_getting-started_simpleapp-archetype[SimpleApp archetype]:

[source,java]
----
@SimpleObjectsFixture
Feature: List and Create New Simple Objects

  @integration
  Scenario: Existing simple objects can be listed and new ones created
    Given there are initially 3 simple objects
    When  I create a new simple object
    Then  there are 4 simple objects
----

The `@SimpleObjectsFixture` is a custom tag we've specified to indicate the prerequisite fixtures to be loaded; more on this in a moment. The `@integration` tag, meanwhile, says that this feature should be run with integration-level scope.


[NOTE]
====
Although BDD specs are most commonly used for end-to-end tests (ie at the same scope as an integration test), the two concerns (expressability of a test to a business person vs granularity of the test) should not be conflated. There are a couple of http://silkandspinach.net/2013/01/18/a-testing-strategy/[good] blog http://claysnow.co.uk/the-testing-iceberg/[posts] discussing http://claysnow.co.uk/living-documentation-can-be-readable-and-fast/[this]. The basic idea is to avoid the overhead of a heavy-duty integration test if possible.

Apache Isis does also support running BDD specs in unit test mode; by annotating the scenario with the `@unit` (rather than `@integration` tag).  When running under unit-level scope, the Apache Isis system is _not_ instantiated.  Instead, the `ScenarioExecution` class returns JMock mocks (except for the `WrapperFactory`, if configured).

To support unit testing scope Apache Isis provides the `InMemoryDB` class; a glorified hashmap of "persisted" objects.  Use of this utility class is optional.

Writing a BDD spec that supports both modes of operation therefore takes more effort and we expect most users interested in BDD will use integration-testing scope; for these reasons we have chosen _not_ to include unit-testing support in the xref:ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_getting-started_simpleapp-archetype[SimpleApp archetype].  For those who do require faster-executing test suite, it's worthwhile knowing that Apache Isis can support this.

====


The `RunSpecs` class to run this feature (and any other features in this package or subpackages) is just boilerplate

[source,java]
----
@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(
        format = {
                "html:target/cucumber-html-report"
                ,"json:target/cucumber.json"
        },
        glue={"classpath:domainapp.integtests.specglue"},
        strict = true,
        tags = { "~@backlog", "~@ignore" })
public class RunSpecs {
    // intentionally empty
}
----

The JSON formatter allows integration with enhanced reports, for example as provided by http://www.masterthought.net/section/cucumber-reporting[Masterthought.net] (screenshots at end of page). (Commented out) configuration for this is provided in the xref:ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_getting-started_simpleapp-archetype[SimpleApp archetype].

The bootstrapping of Apache Isis can be moved into a `BootstrappingGlue` step definition:

[source,java]
----
public class BootstrappingGlue extends CukeGlueAbstract {
    @Before(value={"@integration"}, order=100)
    public void beforeScenarioIntegrationScope() {
        org.apache.log4j.PropertyConfigurator.configure("logging.properties");
        SimpleAppSystemInitializer.initIsft();

        before(ScenarioExecutionScope.INTEGRATION);
    }
    @After
    public void afterScenario(cucumber.api.Scenario sc) {
        assertMocksSatisfied();
        after(sc);
    }
}
----

The fixture to run also lives in its own step definition, https://github.com/apache/isis/blob/07fe61ef3fb029ae36427f60da2afeeb931e4f88/example/application/simpleapp/integtests/src/test/java/domainapp/integtests/specglue/CatalogOfFixturesGlue.java#L24[`CatalogOfFixturesGlue`]:

[source,java]
----
public class CatalogOfFixturesGlue extends CukeGlueAbstract {
    @Before(value={"@integration", "@SimpleObjectsFixture"}, order=20000)
    public void integrationFixtures() throws Throwable {
        scenarioExecution().install(new RecreateSimpleObjects());
    }
}
----

Note that this is annotated with a tag (`@SimpleObjectsFixture`) so that the correct fixture runs. (We might have a whole variety of these).

The step definitions pertaining to `SimpleObject` domain entity then reside in the https://github.com/apache/isis/blob/07fe61ef3fb029ae36427f60da2afeeb931e4f88/example/application/simpleapp/integtests/src/test/java/domainapp/integtests/specglue/modules/simple/SimpleObjectGlue.java#L31[`SimpleObjectGlue`] class. This is where the heavy lifting gets done:

[source,java]
----
public class SimpleObjectGlue extends CukeGlueAbstract {
    @Given("^there are.* (\\d+) simple objects$")
    public void there_are_N_simple_objects(int n) throws Throwable {
        try {
            final List<SimpleObject> findAll = service(SimpleObjects.class).listAll();
            assertThat(findAll.size(), is(n));
            putVar("list", "all", findAll);

        } finally {
            assertMocksSatisfied();
        }
    }
    @When("^I create a new simple object$")
    public void I_create_a_new_simple_object() throws Throwable {
        service(SimpleObjects.class).create(UUID.randomUUID().toString());
    }
}
----
