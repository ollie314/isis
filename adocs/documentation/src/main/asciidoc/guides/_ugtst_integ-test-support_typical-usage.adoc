This example adapted from the link:http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-app-todoapp[Isis addons' todoapp] (non-ASF).  The code we want to test (simplified) is:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem ... {

    private boolean complete;
    @Property( editing = Editing.DISABLED )
    public boolean isComplete() {
        return complete;
    }
    public void setComplete(final boolean complete) {
        this.complete = complete;
    }

    @Action()
    public ToDoItem completed() {
        setComplete(true);
        ...
        return this;
    }
    public String disableCompleted() {
        return isComplete() ? "Already completed" : null;
    }
    ...
}
----

We typically put the bootstrapping of Apache Isis into a superclass (`AbstractToDoIntegTest` below), then subclass as required.

For this test (of the "completed()" action) we need an instance of a `ToDoItem` that is not yet complete.  Here's the setup:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItemIntegTest extends AbstractToDoIntegTest {

    @Inject
    FixtureScripts fixtureScripts;                              // <1>
    @Inject
    ToDoItems toDoItems;                                        // <2>
    ToDoItem toDoItem;                                          // <3>

    @Before
    public void setUp() throws Exception {
        RecreateToDoItemsForCurrentUser fixtureScript =         // <4>
            new RecreateToDoItemsForCurrentUser();
        fixtureScripts.runFixtureScript(fixtureScript, null);
        final List<ToDoItem> all = toDoItems.notYetComplete();  // <5>
        toDoItem = wrap(all.get(0));                            // <6>
    }
    ...
}
----
<1> the xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_super_FixtureScripts[`FixtureScripts`] domain service is injected, providing us with the ability to run fixture scripts
<2> likewise, an instance of the `ToDoItems` domain service is injected.  We'll use this to lookup...
<3> the object under test, held as a field
<4> the fixture script for this test; it deletes all existing todo items (for the current user only) and then recreates them
<5> we lookup one of the just-created todo items...
<6> and then wrap it so that our interactions with it are as if through the UI



The following code tests the happy case, that a not-yet-completed `ToDoItem` can be completed by invoking the `completed()` action:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItemIntegTest ... {
    ...
    public static class Completed extends ToDoItemIntegTest { // <1>
        @Test
        public void happyCase() throws Exception {
            // given
            assertThat(toDoItem.isComplete()).isFalse();      // <2>
            // when
            toDoItem.completed();
            // then
            assertThat(toDoItem.isComplete()).isTrue();
        }
        ...
    }
}
----
<1> the idiom we follow is to use nested static classes to identify the class responsibility being tested
<2> the http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-app-todoapp[todoapp] uses link:http://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj[AssertJ].

What about when a todo item is already completed?  The `disableCompleted()` method in the class says that it shouldn't be allowed (the action would be greyed out in the UI with an appropriate tooltip).  The following test verifies this:

[source,java]
----
        @Test
        public void cannotCompleteIfAlreadyCompleted() throws Exception {
            // given
            unwrap(toDoItem).setComplete(true);                     // <1>
            // expect
            expectedExceptions.expectMessage("Already completed");  // <2>
            // when
            toDoItem.completed();
        }
----
<1> we unwrap the domain object in order to set its state directly
<2> the expectedExceptions link:http://junit.org/apidocs/org/junit/rules/ExpectedException.html[JUnit rule] (defined by a superclass) verifies that the appropiate exception is indeed thrown (in the "when")


And what about the fact that the underlying "complete" property is disabled (the `@Disabled` annotation?).  If the `ToDoItem` is put into edit mode in the UI, the complete checkbox should remain read-only.  Here's a verify similar test that verifies this also:

[source,java]
----
        @Test
        public void cannotSetPropertyDirectly() throws Exception {
            // expect
            expectedExceptions.expectMessage("Always disabled");  // <1>
            // when
            toDoItem.setComplete(true);
        }
----
<1> again we use the exceptedExceptions rule.
