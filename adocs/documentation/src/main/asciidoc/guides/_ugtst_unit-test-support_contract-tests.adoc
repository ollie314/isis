Contract tests ensure that all instances of a particular idiom/pattern that occur within your codebase are implemented correctly.  You could think of them as being a way to enforce a certain type of coding standard.  Implementation-wise they use link:https://code.google.com/p/reflections/[Reflections] library to scan for classes.



== ``SortedSet``s

This contract test automatically checks that all fields of type `java.util.Collection` are declared as `java.util.SortedSet`. In other words, it precludes either `java.util.List` or `java.util.Set` from being used as a collection.

For example, the following passes the contract test:

[source,java]
----
public class Department {
    private SortedSet<Employee> employees = new TreeSet<Employee>();
    ...
}
----

whereas this would not:

[source,java]
----
public class SomeDomainObject {
    private List<Employee> employees = new ArrayList<Employee>();
    ...
}
----

If using DataNucleus against an RDBMS (as you probably are) then we strongly recommend that you implement this test, for several reasons:

* first, ``Set``s align more closely to the relational model than do ``List``s. A ``List`` must have an additional index to specify order.

* second, `SortedSet` is preferable to `Set` because then the order is well-defined and predictable (to an end user, to the programmer). +
+
The xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_utility_ObjectContracts[`ObjectContracts`]  utility class substantially simplifies the task of implementing `Comparable` in your domain classes.

* third, if the relationship is bidirectional then JDO/Objectstore will automatically maintain the relationship.

To use the contract test, subclass `SortedSetsContractTestAbstract`, specifying the root package to search for domain classes.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class SortedSetsContractTestAll extends SortedSetsContractTestAbstract {

    public SortedSetsContractTestAll() {
        super("org.estatio.dom");
        withLoggingTo(System.out);
    }
}
----



== Bidirectional

This contract test automatically checks that bidirectional 1:m or 1:1 associations are being maintained correctly (assuming that they follow the xref:ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_how-tos_entity-relationships_managed-1-to-m-bidirectional-relationships[mutual registration pattern]

[TIP]
====
(If using the JDO objectstore, then) there is generally no need to programmatically maintain 1:m relationships (indeed it may introduce subtle errors). For more details, see xref:ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_how-tos_entity-relationships_managed-1-to-m-bidirectional-relationships[here].  Also check out the templates in the developers' guide (xref:dg.adoc#_dg_ide_intellij_live-templates[live templates for IntelliJ] / xref:dg.adoc#_dg_ide_eclipse_editor-templates[editor templates for Eclipse]) for further guidance.
====

For example, suppose that `ParentDomainObject` and `ChildDomainObject` have a 1:m relationship (`ParentDomainObject#children` / `ChildDomainObject#parent`), and also `PeerDomainObject` has a 1:1 relationship with itself (`PeerDomainObject#next` / `PeerDomainObject#previous`).

The following will exercise these relationships:

[source,java]
----
public class BidirectionalRelationshipContractTestAll
        extends BidirectionalRelationshipContractTestAbstract {

    public BidirectionalRelationshipContractTestAll() {
        super("org.apache.isis.core.unittestsupport.bidir",
                ImmutableMap.<Class<?>,Instantiator>of(
                    ChildDomainObject.class, new InstantiatorForChildDomainObject(),
                    PeerDomainObject.class, new InstantiatorSimple(PeerDomainObjectForTesting.class)
                ));
        withLoggingTo(System.out);
    }
}
----

The first argument to the constructor scopes the search for domain objects; usually this would be something like `&quot;com.mycompany.dom&quot;`.

The second argument provides a map of `Instantiator` for certain of the domain object types. This has two main purposes. First, for abstract classes, it nominates an alternative concrete class to be instantiated. Second, for classes (such as `ChildDomainObject`) that are `Comparable` and are held in a `SortedSet`), it provides the ability to ensure that different instances are unique when compared against each other. If no `Instantiator` is provided, then the contract test simply attempts to instantiates the class.

If any of the supporting methods (`addToXxx()`, `removeFromXxx()`, `modifyXxx()` or `clearXxx()`) are missing, the relationship is skipped.

To see what's going on (and to identify any skipped relationships), use the `withLoggingTo()` method call. If any assertion fails then the error should be descriptive enough to figure out the problem (without enabling logging).

The example tests can be found https://github.com/apache/isis/tree/master/core/unittestsupport/src/test/java/org/apache/isis/core/unittestsupport/bidir[here].



== Injected Services Method

It is quite common for some basic services to be injected in a project-specific domain object superclass; for example a `ClockService` might generally be injected everywhere:

[source,java]
----
public abstract class EstatioDomainObject {
    @javax.inject.Inject
    protected ClockService clockService;
}
----

If a subclass inadvertantly overrides this method and provides its own `ClockService` field, then the field in the superclass will never initialized. As you might imagine, ``NullPointerException``s could then arise.

This contract test automatically checks that the `injectXxx(...)` method, to allow for injected services, is not overridable, ie `final`.

[NOTE]
====
This contract test is semi-obsolete; most of the time you will want to use `@javax.inject.Inject` on fields rather than the `injectXxx()` method.  The feature dates from a time before Apache Isis supported the `@Inject` annotation.
====


To use the contract test, , subclass `SortedSetsContractTestAbstract`, specifying the root package to search for domain classes.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class InjectServiceMethodMustBeFinalContractTestAll extends InjectServiceMethodMustBeFinalContractTestAbstract {

    public InjectServiceMethodMustBeFinalContractTestAll() {
        super("org.estatio.dom");
        withLoggingTo(System.out);
    }
}
----




== Value Objects

The `ValueTypeContractTestAbstract` automatically tests that a custom value type implements `equals()` and `hashCode()` correctly.

For example, testing JDK's own `java.math.BigInteger` can be done as follows:

[source,java]
----
public class ValueTypeContractTestAbstract_BigIntegerTest extends ValueTypeContractTestAbstract<BigInteger> {

    @Override
    protected List<BigInteger> getObjectsWithSameValue() {
        return Arrays.asList(new BigInteger("1"), new BigInteger("1"));
    }

    @Override
    protected List<BigInteger> getObjectsWithDifferentValue() {
        return Arrays.asList(new BigInteger("2"));
    }
}
----
