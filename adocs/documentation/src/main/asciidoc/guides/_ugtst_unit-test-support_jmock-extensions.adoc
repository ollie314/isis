As noted earlier, for unit tests we tend to use link:http://www.jmock.org[JMock] as our mocking library.  The usual given/when/then format gets an extra step:

* *given* the system is in this state
* *expecting* these interactions (set up the mock expectations here)
* *when* I poke it with a stick
* *then* these state changes and interactions with Mocks should have occurred.

If using JMock then the interactions (in the "then") are checked automatically by a JUnit rule.  However, you probably will still have some state changes to assert upon.

[TIP]
.Distinguish between queries vs mutators
====
For mock interactions that simply retrieve some data, your test should not need to verify that it occurred.  If the system were to be refactored and starts caching some data, you don't really want your tests to start breaking because they are no longer performing a query that once they did.  If using JMock API this means using the `allowing(..)` method to set up the expectation.

On the other hand mocks that mutate the state of the system you probably should assert have occurred.  If using JMock this typically means using the `oneOf(...)` method.

For more tips on using JMock and mocking in general, check out the link:http://www.growing-object-oriented-software.com/[GOOS] book, written by JMock's authors, Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce and also link:http://natpryce.com/articles.html[Nat's blog].

Apache Isis' unit test support provides `JUnitRuleMockery2` which is an extension to the link:http://www.jmock.org/[JMock]'s `JunitRuleMockery`.  It provides a simpler API and also providing support for autowiring.


For example, here we see that the class under test, an instance of `CollaboratingUsingSetterInjection`, is automatically wired up with its `Collaborator`:

[source,java]
----
public class JUnitRuleMockery2Test_autoWiring_setterInjection_happyCase {

    @Rule
    public JUnitRuleMockery2 context = JUnitRuleMockery2.createFor(Mode.INTERFACES_AND_CLASSES);

    @Mock
    private Collaborator collaborator;

    @ClassUnderTest
    private CollaboratingUsingSetterInjection collaborating;

    @Test
    public void wiring() {
        assertThat(collaborating.collaborator, is(not(nullValue())));
    }
}
----

[NOTE]
====
Isis also includes (and automatically uses) a link:http://www.javassist.org[Javassist]-based implementation of JMock's link:http://www.jmock.org/mocking-classes.html[`ClassImposteriser`] interface, so that you can mock out concrete classes as well as interfaces.  We've provided this rather than JMock's own cglib-based implementation (which is problematic for us given its own dependencies on link:http://asm.ow2.org/[asm]).
