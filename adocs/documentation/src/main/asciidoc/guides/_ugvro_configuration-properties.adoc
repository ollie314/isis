The Restful Objects viewer provides a couple of configuration option that extend/simplify/alter the representations
generated from the Restful Objects specification.

These configuration properties are typically stored in `WEB-INF/viewer_restfulobjects.properties`.  However, you can
place all configuration properties into `WEB-INF/isis.properties` if you wish (the configuration properties from all
config files are merged together).


[[_ugvro_configuration-properties_standard]]
== Standard

The following configuration properties are supported:

.Restful Objects Viewer Configuration Properties
[cols="2a,1,3", options="header"]
|===
|Property
|Value +
(_default value_)
|Description

|`isis.viewer.restfulobjects.` +
`honorUiHints`
| `true`,`false` (`_false_`)
|A mechanism for reducing the number of round-trips by eagerly rendering collections; discussed xref:ugvro.adoc#_ugvro_ro-spec_extensions_minimizing-round-trips_honor-ui-hints[here].

|`isis.viewer.restfulobjects.` +
`strictAcceptChecking`
| `true`,`false` (`_false_`)
|Whether to strictly enforce the `Accept` header checking for the default RO-spec representations (by the
`ContentNegotiationServiceForRestfulObjectsV1_0` service). Will otherwise accept anything.  +

This is convenient because it allows the `Accept` header to be set to that of the
xref:ugvro.adoc#_ugvro_simplified-representations[Apache Isis profile] for all resources, rather than simply the
handful of resources that supported that profile.

|===


[[_ugvro_configuration-properties_deprecated]]
== Deprecated

There are also a number of configuration properties that can be used to suppress or simplify the default RO-spec
representations.

These configuration properties pre-date the support, introduced in `1.11.0`, for the Apache Isis profile, and
are limited by the fact that they are global configuration settings, so cannot be influenced on a request-by-request
basis (as is the case with the `Accept` header used for the Apache Isis profile). They have therefore been
deprecated, and may be removed in the future.

Nevertheless, those configuration properties are:

.Deprecated Configuration Properties
[cols="2a,1,3", options="header"]
|===
|Property
|Value +
(_default value_)
|Description

|`isis.viewer.restfulobjects.` +
`suppressDescribedByLinks`
| `true`,`false` (`_false_`)
|Suppresses the "describedby" links (on all representations)

|`isis.viewer.restfulobjects.` +
`suppressUpdateLink`
| `true`,`false` (`_false_`)
|suppresses the  "update" link (on object representation)

|`isis.viewer.restfulobjects.` +
`suppressMemberId`
| `true`,`false` (`_false_`)
|suppresses the  "id" json-prop for object members (on object representation and member detail representations)

|`isis.viewer.restfulobjects.` +
`suppressMemberLinks`
| `true`,`false` (`_false_`)
|suppresses the  "links" json-prop for object members (on the object representation and member detail representations)

|`isis.viewer.restfulobjects.` +
`suppressMemberExtensions`
| `true`,`false` (`_false_`)
|suppresses the  "extensions" json-prop for object members (on the object representation and member detail representations)

|`isis.viewer.restfulobjects.` +
`suppressMemberDisabledReason`
| `true`,`false` (`_false_`)
|suppresses the  "disabledReason" json-prop for object members (on the object representation and member detail representations)

|`isis.viewer.restfulobjects.` +
`objectPropertyValuesOnly`
| `true`,`false` (`_false_`)
| See xref:ugvro.adoc#_ugvro_simplified-representations_configuration-properties_object-property-values-only[discussion] below.
|

|===


For example, these configuration properties could all be added in the `WEB-INF/viewer_restfulobjects.properties`):

[source,ini]
----
isis.viewer.restfulobjects.suppressDescribedByLinks=true
isis.viewer.restfulobjects.suppressUpdateLink=true
isis.viewer.restfulobjects.suppressMemberId=true
isis.viewer.restfulobjects.suppressMemberLinks=true
isis.viewer.restfulobjects.suppressMemberExtensions=true
isis.viewer.restfulobjects.suppressMemberDisabledReason=true
----


[NOTE]
====
If these configuration settings are set in conjunction with using the
xref:ugvro.adoc#_ugvro_simplified-representations_apache-isis-profile[Apache Isis profile], then the special `$$ro`
property in the representations with reflect these settings.
====



If the `objectPropertyValuesOnly` configuration property is set:

[source,ini]
----
isis.viewer.restfulobjects.objectPropertyValuesOnly=true
----

then this generates a representation such as:

[source,javascript]
----
{
    "title" : "Buy milk due by 2014-10-27",
    "domainType" : "TODO",
    "instanceId" : "0",
    "members" : {
        "description" : "Buy milk",
        "category" : "Domestic",
        "subcategory" : "Shopping",
        "complete" : false,
        "versionSequence" : 1,
        "relativePriority" : 2,
        "dueBy" : "2014-10-27",
        "cost" : "0.75",
        "notes" : null,
        "attachment" : null,
        "doc" : null
    },
    "links" : [
        {
            "rel" : "self",
            "href" : "http://localhost:8080/restful/objects/TODO/0",
            "method" : "GET",
            "type" : "application/json;profile=\"urn:org.restfulobjects:repr-types/object\"",
            "title" : "Buy milk due by 2014-10-27"
        },
        {
            "rel" : "describedby",
            "href" : "http://localhost:8080/restful/domain-types/TODO",
            "method" : "GET",
            "type" : "application/json;profile=\"urn:org.restfulobjects:repr-types/domain-type\""
        }
    ],
    "extensions" : {
        "oid" : "TODO:0"
    },
}
