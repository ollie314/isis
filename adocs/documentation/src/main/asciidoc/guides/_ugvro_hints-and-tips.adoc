Since the Restful Objects viewer is designed for computer programs to interact with (rather than human beings), it can be a little difficult to explore and generally "grok" how it works.

This section provides a few hints-and-tips to help you on your way.




== Using Chrome Tools

This link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-TOvVYWCHc[screencast] shows how to explore the Restful API using Chrome plugins/extensions, and how we use them to write end-2-end (TCK) tests for the Restful Objects viewer.





== AngularJS Tips

The hypermedia API exposed by Apache Isis' Restful Objects viewer is intended be support both bespoke custom-written viewers as well as generic viewers. Indeed, we expect most clients consuming the API will be bespoke, not generic.

This page captures one or two tips on using AngularJS to write such a bespoke client.


=== Invoking a GET link (eg invoking a query action)

Suppose you have a `CustomerService` providing a `findCustomer` action:

[source,java]
----
public class CustomerService {
    public String id() { return "customers"; }
    @Action(semantics=SemanticsOf.SAFE)
    public Customer findCustomer(
            @ParameterLayout(named="customerName")
            final String customerName) {
        ...
    }
}
----

Restful Objects will expose this as action with the following link that looks something like:

[source,javascript]
----
{
  "rel" : "urn:org.restfulobjects:rels/invoke",
  "href" : "http://localhost:8080/restful/services/customers/actions/findCustomer/invoke",
  "method" : "GET",
  "type" : "application/json;profile=\"urn:org.restfulobjects:repr-types/action-result\"",
  "arguments" : {
    "customerName" : {
      "value" : null
    }
  }
}
----

You can then invoke this using AngularJs' `$resource` service as follows.

[source,javascript]
----
var findCustomer = $resource("http://localhost:8080/restful/services/customers/actions/findCustomer/invoke?:queryString");
var findCustomerArgs = {
  "customerName": {
      "value": "Fred"
    }
};
findCustomer.get({queryString: JSON.stringify(findCustomerArgs)}, function(data) { ... } )
----

Here the `:queryString` placeholder in the initial `$resource` constructor is expanded with a stringified version of the JSON object representing the args. Note how the `findCustomerArgs` is the same as the `&quot;arguments&quot;` attribute in the original link (with a value provided instead of `null`).


=== Invoking a PUT or POST link

If the method is a PUT or a POST, then no `:queryString` placeholder is required in the URL, and the args are instead part of the body.

Use `$resource.put(...)` or `$resource.post(...)` instead.



== Pretty printing

The JSON representations generated by the Restful Objects viewer are in compact form if the xref:rgcfg.adoc#_rgcfg_deployment-types[deployment type] is SERVER (ie production), but will automatically be "pretty printed" (in other words indented) if the deployment type is PROTOTYPE.
