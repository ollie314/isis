The representations defined by the RO spec are very rich and enable complex client-side applications to be built.
However, their sophistication can be an impediment to their use if one wishes to write a simple app using third-party
components that expect to consume much simpler representations.  Examples of such tools are

As of `1.11.0`, Apache Isis provides support for its own simplified representation for the most commonly-used
representations.  This is implemented using the `ContentNegotiationService` described in the
xref:ugvro.adoc#_ugvro_architecture[architecture] chapter.



[[_ugvro_simplified-representations_apache-isis-profile]]
== The Apache Isis "Profile"

The RO spec uses the standard `Accept` header for content negotiation, and defines its own "profile" for the standard
representations; these take the form:

[source]
----
Accept: application/json;profile="urn:org.restfulobjects:repr-types/xxx"
----

where "xxx" varies by resource.  The detail can be found in section 2.4.1 of the RO spec.

The Apache Isis viewer also defines its own "Isis" profile which enables the client to request simplified
representations for the most frequently accessed resources.  This is done by specifying an `Accept` header of:

[source]
----
Accept: application/json;profile="urn:org.apache.isis/v1"
----

Not every resource supports this header, but the most commonly accessed ones do.  In each case the server will set the
`Content-Type` header so that the client knows how to process the representation.

The link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSqapQDY_4[screencast] demonstrates the feature.



The sections below explain in a little more detail what is returned when this profile is activated.


[[_ugvro_simplified-representations_domain-object]]
== Domain Object

If a domain object resource (section 14) is accessed with the Apache Isis profile, the resultant representation is a
JSON object with simple key/value pairs for each property.

The contents of any collections are also eagerly returned, consisting of an array of elements of each referenced
object.  Each such element contains key/value pairs of each property (in other words, a grid of data is returned).
Each element also has a special `$$href` property (so that the client can easily navigate to a resource for that
object) and a `$$title` property (to use as a label, eg the hyperlink text).

In addition, the representation defined by the RO spec is also included, under a special `$$ro` property.

For example, using the (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-app-todoapp[Isis addons' todoapp], accessing
this resource:

[source]
----
http://localhost:8080/restful/objects/TODO/45
----

with an `Accept` request header of:

[source]
----
Accept: application/json;profile="urn:org.apache.isis/v1"
----

returns the following representation:

[source]
----
{
  "$$href" : "http://localhost:8080/restful/objects/TODO/45",       // <1>
  "$$instanceId" : "45",                                            // <2>
  "$$title" : "Buy bread due by 2015-12-04",                        // <3>
  "description" : "Buy bread",                                      // <4>
  "category" : "Domestic",

    "$$instanceId" : "46",
    "$$title" : "Buy milk due by 2015-12-04",

     ...
  } ],

  "$$ro" : {                                                        // <6>
    "links" : [ ... ],
    "extensions" : { ... },
    "title" : "Buy bread due by 2015-12-04",

<6> special `$$ro` json-prop, being the normal RO Spec representation for this object

with a `Content-Type` header:

[source]
----
Content-Type: application/json;
              profile="urn:org.apache.isis/v1";repr-type="object"
----


[[_ugvro_simplified-representations_object-collection]]
== Domain Object Collection

If a domain object collection (section 17) is accessed with this profile, then the resultant representation is as
an array of elements of key/value for each referenced object, and again each element the containing the key/value
pairs of the properties of that object (a grid, again). +

In addition, the representation defined by the RO spec is also included, as a special object with a single `$$ro`
property.

For example, using the (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-app-todoapp[Isis addons' todoapp], accessing
this resource:

[source]
----
http://localhost:8080/restful/objects/TODO/45/collections/similarTo
----

with an `Accept` request header of:

[source]
----
Accept: application/json;profile="urn:org.apache.isis/v1"
----

returns the following representation:

[source]
----
[                                                                   // <1>
{
  "$$href" : "http://localhost:8080/restful/objects/TODO/46",       // <2>
  "$$instanceId" : "46",                                            // <3>

[[_ugvro_simplified-representations_action-invocation]]
== Action Invocation

When an action is invoked, it can return a domain object, a list, a scalar, or return nothing.

=== Returning an Object

If the action returned an object, then the domain object representation described
xref:ugvro.adoc#_ugvro_simplified-representations_domain-object[above] is returned.

For example, using the (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-app-todoapp[Isis addons' todoapp], accessing
this resource:

[source]
----
http://localhost:8080/restful/objects/TODO/45/actions/updateCost/invoke
----

with an `Accept` request header of:

[source]
----
Accept: application/json;profile="urn:org.apache.isis/v1"
----

returns the following representation:

[source]
----

{
  "$$href" : "http://localhost:8080/restful/objects/TODO/45",
  "$$instanceId" : "45",
  "$$title" : "Buy bread due by 2015-12-04",
  "description" : "Buy bread",
  "category" : "Domestic",
  "subcategory" : "Shopping",
  "complete" : false,
  ...
  "similarTo" : [ ... ]
  ...
  "$$ro" : { ... }
}
----

with a `Content-Type` of:

[source]
----
Content-Type: application/json;profile="urn:org.apache.isis/v1";repr-type="object"
----

\... in other words no different to a representation obtained of the returned domain object directly.


=== Returning a List

On the other hand if the action returned a list (a "standalone" collection, then an array representation is returned.
This is very similar to that returned by a
xref:ugvro.adoc#_ugvro_simplified-representations_object-collection[(parented) object collection], though with a
slightly different `Content-Type` to distinguish.

For example, using the (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-app-todoapp[Isis addons' todoapp], accessing
this resource:

[source]
----
http://localhost:8080/restful/services/ToDoItems/actions/notYetComplete/invoke
----

with an `Accept` request header of:

[source]
----
Accept: application/json;profile="urn:org.apache.isis/v1"
----

returns the following representation:

[source]
----
[ {
  "$$href" : "http://localhost:8080/restful/objects/TODO/45",
  "$$instanceId" : "45",
  "$$title" : "Buy bread due by 2015-12-04",
  "description" : "Buy bread",
  "category" : "Domestic",
  ...
}, {
  "$$href" : "http://localhost:8080/restful/objects/TODO/46",
  "$$instanceId" : "46",
  "$$title" : "Buy milk due by 2015-12-04",
  "description" : "Buy milk",
  "category" : "Domestic",
  ...
},
...
, {
  "$$ro" : {
    "links" : [ ... ]
    "resulttype" : "list",
    "result" : { ... }
      "value" : [ ... ],
      "links" : [ ... ],
      "extensions" : { }
    }
  }
} ]
----

with a `Content-Type` header:

[source]
----
Content-Type: application/json;profile="urn:org.apache.isis/v1";repr-type="list"
----

=== Returning Scalar/Nothing

Note that actions returning scalar values or nothing (which includes `void` actions) are not supported; for these the
regular RO spec representation will be returned.


[[_ugvro_simplified-representations_other-representations]]
== Supporting other Representations

Sometimes though you may want to extend or change the representations generated.  This might be because you want to
write a RESTful client that uses a particular library (say a Javascript library or web components) that can only handle representations in a certain form.

Or, you might want to have Apache Isis generate representations according to some other "standard", of which there are
many:

* Mike Kelly's http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html[HAL] specification
* Mike Amundsen's http://amundsen.com/media-types/collection/[Collection+JSON] specification
* Kevin Swiber's https://github.com/kevinswiber/siren[Siren] specification
* Steve Klabnik's http://jsonapi.org/[JSON API] specification
* Gregg Cainus' https://github.com/cainus/hyper-json-spec[Hyper+JSON] specification
* the W3C's https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/[JSON-LD] specification
* Markus Lanthaler's http://www.markus-lanthaler.com/hydra/[Hydra] specification.

A good discussion about the relative merits of several of these different hypermedia formats can be found https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/api-craft/NgjzQYVOE4s/EAB2jxtU_TMJ[here].

Or, of course, you may have your own internal specification that you wish to use.

Supporting any of these alternative representations can be achieved by providing a suitable implementation of
`ContentNegotiationService`.  The existing implementations (eg `ContentNegotiationServiceSimplified`) can be used as a
starting point.

[NOTE]
====
These will, admittedly, need to access the internal APIs for the Apache Isis metamodel, and you should be aware that
these are not formal API; they may change over time.  That said, they are very stable and have not changed
significantly over the last few years.
