If all that is required is a very simple representations (of objects), you can configure the Restful Objects viewer
to provide a simplified output, then this can be done with a number of (global) configuration properties.

These configuration properties pre-date the support, introduced in `1.11.0`, for the Apache Isis profile, and
are limited by the fact that they are global configuration settings, so cannot be influenced on a request-by-request
basis (as is the case with the `Accept` header used for the Apache Isis profile). They have therefore been
deprecated, and may be removed in the future.

Details can be found in xref:ugvro.adoc#_ugvro_configuration-properties_deprecated[here].
