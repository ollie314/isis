The Wicket viewer uses http://getbootstrap.com/[Bootstrap] styles and components (courtesy of the https://github.com/l0rdn1kk0n/wicket-bootstrap[Wicket Bootstrap] integration).

Unless a xref:ugvw.adoc#_ugvw_customisation_default-theme[default theme has been specified], the viewer uses the default bootstrap theme. However,
the viewer can also be configured to allow the end-user to switch theme to another theme, in particular one of those provided by http://bootswatch.com[bootswatch.com].

This is done using the following configuration property (in `WEB-INF/viewer_wicket.properties`):

[source,ini]
----
isis.viewer.wicket.themes.showChooser=true
----

.Example 1
image::{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/theme-chooser/example-1.png[width="720px",link="{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/theme-chooser/example-1.png"]


.Example 2:
image::{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/theme-chooser/example-2.png[width="720px",link="{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/theme-chooser/example-2.png"]

It is also possible to restrict the themes shown to some subset of those in bootswatch. This is done using a further
property:

[source,ini]
----
isis.viewer.wicket.themes.enabled=bootstrap-theme,Cosmo,Flatly,Darkly,Sandstone,United
----

where the value is the list of themes (from http://bootswatch.com[bootswatch.com]) to be made available.

[TIP]
====
You can also develop and install a custom themes (eg to fit your company's look-n-feel/interface guidelines); see the xref:ugvw.adoc#_ugvw_extending_custom-bootstrap-theme[Extending] chapter for further details.
