By default the Apache Isis Wicket viewer will always strip wicket tags. However, when running in prototype mode, this behaviour can be overridden using a configuration property:

[source,ini]
----
isis.viewer.wicket.stripWicketTags=false
----

[NOTE]
====
In 1.7.0 and earlier, the behaviour is different; the Apache Isis Wicket viewer will preserve wicket tags when running in Apache Isis' prototype/development mode, but will still strip wicket tags in Apache Isis' server/deployment mode.

We changed the behaviour in 1.8.0 because we found that Internet Explorer can be sensitive to the presence of Wicket tags.
