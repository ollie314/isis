If xref:_user_registration[user registration] has been configured, then the Wicket viewer allows the user to sign-up a new account and to reset their password from the login page.

The 'password reset' link can be suppressed, if required, by setting a configuration flag.



== Screenshots

With 'password reset' not suppressed (the default):

image::{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/suppress-password-reset/login-page-default.png[width="300px",link="{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/suppress-password-reset/login-page-default.png"]

and with the link suppressed:

image::{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/suppress-password-reset/login-page-suppress-password-reset.png[width="300px",link="{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/suppress-password-reset/login-page-suppress-password-reset.png"]



== Configuration

To suppress the 'password reset' link, add the following configuration flag:

[source,ini]
----
isis.viewer.wicket.suppressPasswordReset=true
----

Typically this should be added to the `viewer_wicket.properties` file (in `WEB-INF`), though you can add to `isis.properties` if you wish.

The xref:ugvw.adoc#_ugvw_configuration-properties_suppressing-sign-up[sign up link] can be suppressed in a similar manner.
