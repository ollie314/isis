The Wicket viewer ships with embedded JQuery, so this can be leveraged to perform arbitrary transformations of the rendered page (eg to run some arbitrary JQuery on page load).

[WARNING]
====
Just because something is possible, it doesn't necessarily mean we encourage it.  Please be aware that there is no formal API for any custom javascript that you might implement to target; future versions of Apache Isis might break your code.

If possible, consider using the `ComponentFactory` API described in the xref:ugvw.adoc#_ugvw_extending[Extending] chapter.
====

To register your Javascript code, adjusting the Guice bindings (part of Apache Isis' bootstrapping) in your custom subclass of `IsisWicketApplication`:

    public class MyAppApplication extends IsisWicketApplication {
        @Override
        protected Module newIsisWicketModule() {
            final Module isisDefaults = super.newIsisWicketModule();
            final Module myAppOverrides = new AbstractModule() {
                @Override
                protected void configure() {
                    ...
                    bind(String.class)
                        .annotatedWith(Names.named("applicationJs"))
                        .toInstance("scripts/application.js");
                    ...
                }
            };
            return Modules.override(isisDefaults).with(myAppOverrides);
        }
    }

Currently only one such `.js` file can be registered.
