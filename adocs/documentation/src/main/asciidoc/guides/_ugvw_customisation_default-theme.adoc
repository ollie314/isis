The Apache Isis Wicket viewer uses http://getbootstrap.com/[Bootstrap] styles and components (courtesy of the https://github.com/l0rdn1kk0n/wicket-bootstrap[Wicket Bootstrap] integration).

Unless specified otherwise, the viewer uses the default bootstrap theme. However, this can be changed by overriding `init()` in the application's subclass of `IsisWicketApplication`. For example, to set the http://bootswatch.com/flatly/[bootswatch.com flatly] theme
 as the default, use:

[source,java]
----
@Override
protected void init() {
    super.init();
    IBootstrapSettings settings = Bootstrap.getSettings();
    settings.setThemeProvider(new BootswatchThemeProvider(BootswatchTheme.Flatly));
}
----

If you have developed a custom Bootstrap theme (as described xref:ugvw.adoc#_ugvw_extending_custom-bootstrap-theme[here]) then this can also be specified using the https://github.com/l0rdn1kk0n/wicket-bootstrap/wiki/Themes[Wicket Bootstrap API].
