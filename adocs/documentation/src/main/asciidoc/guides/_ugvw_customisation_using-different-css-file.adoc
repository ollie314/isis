If for some reason you wanted to name the CSS file differently (eg `stylesheets/myapp.css`), then adjust the Guice bindings (part of Apache Isis' bootstrapping) in your custom subclass of `IsisWicketApplication`:

[source,java]
----
public class MyAppApplication extends IsisWicketApplication {
    @Override
    protected Module newIsisWicketModule() {
        final Module isisDefaults = super.newIsisWicketModule();
        final Module myAppOverrides = new AbstractModule() {
            @Override
            protected void configure() {
                ...
                bind(String.class)
                    .annotatedWith(Names.named("applicationCss"))
                    .toInstance("stylesheets/myapp.css");
                ...
            }
        };

        return Modules.override(isisDefaults).with(myAppOverrides);
    }
}
----

As indicated above, this file is resolved relative to `src/main/webapp`.
