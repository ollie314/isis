The Wicket viewer allows you to customize the GUI in several (progressively more sophisticated) ways:

* by xref:ugvw.adoc#_ugvw_customisation_tweaking-css-classes[tweaking the UI using CSS]
* by xref:ugvw.adoc#_ugvw_customisation_custom-javascript[tweaking the UI using Javascript]
* by writing a xref:ugvw.adoc#_ugvw_extending_custom-bootstrap-theme[custom bootstrap theme]
* by xref:ugvw.adoc#_ugvw_extending_replacing-page-elements[replacing elements of the page] using the `ComponentFactory` interface
* by implementing xref:ugvw.adoc#_ugvw_extending_custom-pages[replacement page implementations] for the standard page types

The first two of these options are discussed in the xref:ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] chapter.  This chapter describes the remaining "heavier-weight/more powerful" options.

The chapter wraps up with a technique for prototyping, allowing user/passwords to be specified as query arguments.
