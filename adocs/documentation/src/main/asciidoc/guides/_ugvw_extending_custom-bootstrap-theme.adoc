The Apache Isis Wicket viewer uses http://getbootstrap.com/[Bootstrap] styles and components (courtesy of the https://github.com/l0rdn1kk0n/wicket-bootstrap[Wicket Bootstrap] integration).

By default the viewer uses the default bootstrap theme. It is possible to configure the Wicket viewer to allow the user to xref:ugvw.adoc#_ugvw_configuration-properties_showing-theme-chooser[select other themes] provided by http://bootswatch.com[bootswatch.com], and if required one of these can be xref:ugvw.adoc#_ugvw_customisation_default-theme[set as the default].

However, you may instead want to write your own custom theme, for example to fit your company's look-n-feel/interface guidelines. This is done by implementing https://github.com/l0rdn1kk0n/wicket-bootstrap[Wicket Bootstrap]â€™s `de.agilecoders.wicket.core.settings.ITheme` class. This defines:

* the name of the theme
* the resources it needs (the CSS and optional JS and/or fonts), and
* optional urls to load them from a Content Delivery Network (CDN).

To make use of the custom `ITheme` the application should register it by adding the following snippet in
(your application's subclass of) `IsisWicketApplication`:

[source,java]
----
public void init() {
    ...
    IBootstrapSettings settings = new BootstrapSettings();
    ThemeProvider themeProvider = new SingleThemeProvider(new MyTheme());
    settings.setThemeProvider(themeProvider);
    Bootstrap.install(getClass(), settings);
}
