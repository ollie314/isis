This section describes features that are dependent on HTTP request parameters (*not* by setting configuration properties in `isis.properties`).

== Suppressing Header and Footer (Embedded View)

The Wicket viewer provides some support such that an Isis application can be embedded within a host webapp, for example within an iframe.

Currently this support consists simply of being able to suppress the header and/or footer.

=== Screenshots

For example, the regular view is:

image::{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/embedded-view/regular.png[width="720px",link="{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/embedded-view/regular.png"]


With the header and footer both suppressed only the main content is shown:

image::{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/embedded-view/no-header-no-footer.png[width="720px",link="{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/embedded-view/no-header-no-footer.png"]


It is also possible to suppress just the header, or just the footer.


=== Request parameters

To suppress the header, add the following as a request parameter:

[source,ini]
----
isis.no.header
----

and to suppress the header, add the following as a request parameter:

[source,ini]
----
isis.no.footer
----

For example,

[source,ini]
----
http://localhost:8080/wicket/entity/TODO:0?isis.no.header&isis.no.footer
----
