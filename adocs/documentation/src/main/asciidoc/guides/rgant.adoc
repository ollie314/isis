== Annotations

This guide describes the various annotations used by Apache Isis to provide additional metadata about the domain objects.
Most of these are defined by Isis itself, but some are from other libraries.  It also identifies a number of
annotations that are now deprecated, and indicates their replacement.

=== Other Guides

Apache Isis documentation is broken out into a number of user, reference and "supporting procedures" guides.

The user guides available are:

* xref:ugfun.adoc#[Fundamentals]
* xref:ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer]
* xref:ugvro.adoc#[Restful Objects viewer]
* xref:ugvro.adoc#[DataNucleus object store]
* xref:ugsec.adoc#[Security]
* xref:ugtst.adoc#[Testing]
* xref:ugbtb.adoc#[Beyond the Basics]

The reference guides are:

* xref:rgant.adoc#[Annotations] (this guide)
* xref:rgsvc.adoc#[Domain Services]
* xref:rgcfg.adoc#[Configuration Properties]
* xref:rgcms.adoc#[Classes, Methods and Schema]
* xref:rgmvn.adoc#[Apache Isis Maven plugin]
* xref:rgfis.adoc#[Framework Internal Services]

The remaining guides are:

* xref:dg.adoc#[Developers' Guide] (how to set up a development environment
for Apache Isis and contribute back to the project)
* xref:cgcom.adoc#[Committers' Guide] (release procedures and related practices)


=== Examples

To give just a few examples of annotations supported by Apache Isis:

* if a property is read-only, then this can be annotated with `@Property(editing=EditingDISABLED)`.
* if a class has a small fixed set of instances (eg a picklist), then it can be annotated using `@DomainObject(bounded=true)`
* if a class is a domain service and should be automatically instantiated as a singleton, then it can be annotated using `@DomainService`
* if an action is idempotent, then it can be annotated using `@Action(semantics=SemanticsOf.IDEMPOTENT)`.
* if an action parameter is optional, it can be annotated using `@Parameter(optionality=Optionality.OPTIONAL)`

Some annotations act as UI hints, for example:

* if a collection should be rendered "open" rather than collapsed, it can be annotated using `@CollectionLayout(render=RenderType.EAGERLY)`
* if an action has a tooltip, it can be annotated using `@ActionLayout(describedAs=...)`
* if a domain object is bookmarkable, it can be annotated using `@DomainObjectLayout(bookmarking=BookmarkPolicy.AS_ROOT`).
