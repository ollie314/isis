[[_rgcms]]

This reference guide lists and describes various elements of the the Apache Isis Programming Model, specifically
reserved and prefix xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_methods[methods] (such as `title()` and `validate...()`) and various utility and

It also describes the xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_schema[XSD schema] defined by Apache Isis.  One use case is for the
