Deciding whether to use a full stack framework such as Apache Isis means in large part determining to what extent the
applications you need to develop align with the strengths and philosophy of the framework.

This page catalogues a few notable applications that are powered by Apache Isis so you can help make that determination:

* xref:powered-by.adoc#_powered-by_gesconsultor-grc[GESCONSULTOR GRC]
* xref:powered-by.adoc#_powered-by_contactapp[ContactApp]
* xref:powered-by.adoc#_powered-by_commapp[CommApp]
* xref:powered-by.adoc#_powered-by_transport-planner[TransportPlanner]
