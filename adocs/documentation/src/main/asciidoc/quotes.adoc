We'd been looking for a RAD-tool for building our app; after trying different tools, Apache Isis gave us the most confidence for getting the job done.  It's really remarkable how easy it is to use, while contributors and users on the Isis' active mailing list are ready to help on more advanced topics.

A fantastic framework! With Apache Isis we can prototype a deployable application in minutes rather than days.

With its automatic UI and REST web services generation, Apache Isis kept our developers amazed and happy. Having had strenuous experiences with architecture and infrastructure concerns differing from project to project, it's like having back the fun in software development

Apache Isis' focus on the business domain improves communication between our end-users, architects and developers.  Having a better application in a fraction of the time and cost is something we highly appreciate.

I like the guidance Apache Isis gives me for structuring code along the lines of Domain Driven Design. My first web application in plain Java without writing a single line of DDL or HTML/*Script.

What interests me most about Apache Isis is its goal of making both developers and users co-owners of their domain models.  Apache Isis will be of interest to businesses who see their custom software as a strategic investment. It's not trying to be all things to all people, but it has depth and also, I predict, a bright future.

As students most of us prefer sticking with business logic than spending much time with UX enhancements.  Apache Isis provides a great platform to create a perfectly working prototypes with loads of inbuilt UX concerns and customizations without worrying a single bit on the GUI perspective.
And I must say this: "Great Support from the development team"

Apache Isis has allowed us to be focused on the Domain instead of infrastructure issues. The extensive metamodel let us further automate and enhance our custom viewer and integrate with external frameworks.

Apache Isis provided us with a great starting point for our app; we simply took the todoapp archetype and used it as a template to help set up our integration tests and BDD specs.  We were productive almost immediately

Apache Isis enabled us to focus on the problem domain and data quality and - because the UI was generated for us by the framework - not get distracted by UI concerns. Identified security issues were quickly addressed by the Apache Isis committers.

Apache Isis is an easy to learn, efficient and productive RAD platform. Further I can say it is evolving to be
"the best RAD platform" without any exaggerations. The help from the community is simply wonderful.
